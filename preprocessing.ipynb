A truly novel approach that is now being explored seriously is UTx for transgender (TG) women.Although TG UTx has long been discussed at a high level both within the transgender community and among uterus transplant programs, there are now several teams that are actively working to bring this procedure to clinical reality.The first uterus transplant in a transgender female in the twenty-first century is anticipated to take place within the next few years, if not sooner. In this Inklings, we will review UTx for TG individuals along several key elements: technical considerations, hormonal support of the uterus and pregnancy in TG women, emerging ethical and societal implications of TG UTx, and the concept of \\'\\'fourth party\\'\\' reproduction for uterus transplantation in TG women. Feminizing genital affirmation surgery is colloquially referred to as \\'\\'vaginoplasty.\\'\\'With improved medical coverage for gender affirming care and surgery, access to this surgery has risen, and vaginoplasty has been increasingly performed over the last decade (3).Several vaginoplasty techniques exist and there is considerable nuance to the surgery as each surgeon brings their own modifications to the procedure.In general, the procedure includes orchiectomy, deconstruction of the penile anatomy, and creation of a vaginal canal and the vulvar structures (labia, clitoris and vestibule).Most surgeons perform a modification of the penile inversion technique using genital or extragenital skin grafts to line the neovaginal cavity.Alternatively, a peritoneal flap or \\'\\'pull-through\\'\\' vaginoplasty procedure can be performed, a technique that is increasingly adopted by surgeons for either primary cases or revisions. Several technical considerations are important when conceptualizing the process of UTx in TG women.Easily surmountable factors are the differences in the shape of the male and female pelvis.The male pelvis is android in shape with a narrower pubic arch than the typically wider female gynecoid pelvis.The supportive ligaments and connective tissue would also require slight modifications from originally described UTx techniques.Additionally, although the external iliac vessels are anatomically similar between male and female vascular anatomy, differences in the caliber of the internal iliac vessels in the male compared with female pelvis would need to be considered for vascular anastomosis of the graft, as size discrepancies can predispose to thrombosis. The most challenging technical factor in TG UTx is the neovaginal anastomosis.Most patients who have undergone UTx have been patients with Mayer-Rokitansky-K€ uster-Hauser syndrome and in these patients a neovagina was created either through mechanical dilation or a Vecchietti procedure, which places the natal vaginal tissue on expedited mechanical traction (1, 2).There is very limited UTx experience with this kind of anastomosis in a skin-lined or intestinal neovagina, and the major concern in considering UTx in TG individuals is the risk of failure of the vaginal anastomosis as a result of the inherent avascularity of the skin-grafted neovagina.In addition, the effects of an altered microbiome in the absence of typical vaginal epithelium on the reproductive goals of UTx is an underexplored area for UTx.As penile inversion vaginoplasty remains the standard approach to neovagina creation in TG women, the approach for vaginal anastomosis for UTx should be most comparable to patients with Mayer-Rokitansky-K€ uster-Hauser syndrome who have undergone McIndone vaginoplasty followed by UTx. The primary consideration for hormone management in TG women centers on whether candidates should undergo orchiectomy (removal of the testicles) before undergoing TG UTx and pregnancy.In all cases, sperm preservation should be encouraged, allowing for embryo generation with a cisfemale partner or an egg donor.If orchiectomy is not performed before UTx, patients should be counseled to discontinue certain feminizing medications before pregnancy (e.g., spironolactone and finasteride) because of the risk of birth defects in a developing fetus.As TG women would likely have testicular production of androgens, prenatal exposure to androgens could potentially lead to virilization and external genital masculinization of a female fetus, similar to the risks for pregnant cis-females with congenital adrenal hyperplasia.For patients congenital adrenal hyperplasia, the Endocrine Society currently does not recommend specific prenatal treatment protocols to reduce this risk, as such treatment is still considered experimental. Given these considerations, orchiectomy seems most prudent before or concurrent with UTx surgery.The lack of gonads after orchiectomy is unlikely to have a detrimental effect on pregnancy, as success is well-documented of cisfemale patients with severe primary ovarian insufficiency or prenatal oophorectomy sustaining normal pregnancies with a combination of exogenous initial hormone support followed by increases in endogenous placental hormone production despite the lack of functioning ovaries.Cases of intersex pregnancies (involving pregnant patients with both testicular tissue and female genitalia) could serve as a \\'\\'proof of concept\\'\\' for transgender females undergoing UTx; however, reports of these pregnancies are limited and, interestingly, have only involved the birth of male offspring to date. In addition to potential fetal risks, the possible thrombotic risk related to testosterone exposure followed by high levels of circulating estrogens in TG females undergoing pregnancy is not known.The closest analogous population may be TG men on exogenous testosterone who discontinue this therapy to undergo controlled ovarian hyperstimulation-a process involving marked hormonal changes-or transgender men who become pregnant after the discontinuation of testosterone therapy.Reassuringly, uncomplicated pregnancies have been reported for the latter, although additional data will be necessary to achieve any degree of confidence in predicting the thrombotic risk associated with TG UTx. Although the 2013 updated Montreal Criteria restrict recipients of UTx to \\'\\'genetically female\\'\\' individuals, the principles of reproductive justice necessitate a re-evaluation of this historical limitation (4).Indeed, some ethicists have suggested that the Montreal Criteria inappropriately emphasizes nonmaleficence over reproductive autonomy or patientreported perceived benefits of UTx.As we increasingly recognize a history of inequality and discrimination for TG women, we must question whether it is acceptable that TG women are denied access to UTx clinical trials based on their gender identity and transgender status.Such barriers may result from the exclusion of transgender women from current protocols and/ or the failure for investigators to establish trials specific to TG UTx.Further, as studies accumulate revealing high levels of depression and suicidality in transgender women and demonstrate the emotional impact of reduced procreative ability in this population, we must consider the potential benefits of bringing UTx to transgender women (5) .If there is no clear or compelling medical reason that TG women cannot undergo a uterus transplant, then it is ethically supportable that TG women have access to the same life-enhancing and lifepromoting surgical innovations as 46 XX women with absolute uterine factor infertility.This begins by conducting studies of UTx in this population, with methodological approaches that reflect the reported benefits, risks, and limitations of this procedure as described by the potential users of this technology. Balancing concerns for nondiscrimination and health equity, there are several significant unknowns that must be weighed in contemplating clinical trials of TG UTx.This includes how to accurately describe the potential risks within the informed consent process, as well as identifying the outcomes and end points of the trial.Although there has been an influx of data about outcomes from UTx trials in cis-gender women, there are several uncertainties about long-term outcomes and optimal procedural techniques.When and how to compound those unknowns in a new population of TG women raises important ethical questions about acceptable levels of risk.Uterus transplantation was initially designed as a temporary graft for reproductive purposes.For TG women who wish to preserve their transplanted uterus indefinitely with immunosuppression for the purpose of menstruation and enhanced gender alignment, the risk to benefit ratio is unclear and potentially worrisome. A final area related to the study of UTx in TG women is the potentiality for \\'\\'fourth party\\'\\' reproduction.A neonate resulting from TG UTx may be subject to genetic and epigenetic influences of 4 distinct elements: the cis-female or trans-male donor uterus, the environment of the trans-female uterus recipient, the oocyte source, and the sperm source (potentially donor or partner sperm or cryopreserved sperm from the TG female).This also raises important questions about the ethical, legal, and social implications of UTx in TG patients, including considerations of the outcomes not just for TG individuals but also their resulting offspring.To contemplate the genetic and epigenetic complexities of this arrangement is beyond the scope of this Inklings, but indubitably a \\'\\'fourth party\\'\\' reproductive scenario would break new clinical and scientific ground in assisted reproductive technology. The first uterus transplant in a TG woman is very likely in the near future.Although the investigators of this Inklings believe that UTx should not be restricted only to women assigned as genetic females at birth, we would also strongly state that TG UTx (as with all UTx) is best performed by well-established teams at experienced centers, prioritizing multidisciplinary and long-term collaborations between ethicists, medical, and surgical team members.Careful preparation and an understanding of the similarities and differences of transgender UTx clinical trials compared with previously established trials and techniques is essential to the success of this important Fertility and Sterility®\\n\\n==================================================\\n\\nFile: A-behind-the-scenes-look-at-retroperitoneal-ectopi.grobid.tei.json\\nTitle: A behind-the-scenes look at retroperitoneal ectopic pregnancies: How do they get there and where do we go from here?\\nAuthors: Sarah [] Simko, Sadikah [] Behbehani\\nAbstract: \\nBody Text: Although ectopic pregnancies are commonly encountered in clinical practice, there is still much that we do not understand about how they occur.Ectopic pregnancies are pregnancies in which a fertilized egg gets implanted in a location other than the endometrial cavity.These pregnancies account for 2% of all pregnancies; however, their incidence has been increasing (1) .This is likely due to increases in risk factors for ectopic pregnancy, including the causes of tubal scarring and artificial reproductive technology, and improvements in diagnosis over time.Although the mortality rate due to ectopic pregnancies has decreased, 6% of maternal deaths in the United States are attributable to ectopic pregnancies, and these continue to be the leading cause of death in the first trimester (1) . In majority of ectopic pregnancies, the fertilized egg gets implanted within the fallopian tubes; however, those occurring in rarer sites, including cervical, intraovarian, abdominal, mediastinal, and retroperitoneal, can be dangerous and difficult to diagnose.Retroperitoneal ectopic pregnancies (REP), specifically, can evade detection by ultrasound and laparoscopy and can cause massive retroperitoneal hemorrhages.Their mechanism has been the subject of debate and is poorly understood. Multiple theories have been proposed.In cases that occur after artificial reproductive technology, retrograde migration after embryo transfer or uterine perforation, with direct placement of the embryo into the retroperitoneal space, have been suggested as explanations.In cases after spontaneous pregnancies, the theories include implantation to the abdominal cavity, followed by trophoblastic invasion into the retroperitoneum through peritoneal defects, sinus formation, or erosion.The other possible explanations include lymphatic migration, similar to that seen in the spread of malignancy, and migration along the retroperitoneal ovarian vessels. In a case explored by Yuan et al. ( 2), the video article demonstrated that the patient had a history of tubal surgery and underwent in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer.The ectopic pregnancy was located between the aorta and inferior vena cava at L3, and its pathology revealed that the pregnancy was located inside a lymph node, with lymphocyte infiltration visualized in the endometrial decidual tissue.This case provides evidence for the theory of lymphatic migration, but how similar is this case to other cases in the literature? In a recent review by OuYang et al. (3) , 26 cases of REP were identified.Similar to the described case, 50% of the cases of REP occurred in women with prior tubal surgery, and 30.8% of the women had undergone in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer.The location of REP was variable, but in all the cases, the REP was found near retroperitoneal large vessels, with 34.6% located in the pelvis, below the common iliac artery and vein, and 65.4% located in the abdomen, around the common iliac vessels, aorta, and inferior vena cava. The mechanism in these cases remains unclear, and no 1 theory accounts for all the cases.Although some have theorized that defects in the peritoneum, whether congenital, arising from endometriosis, or fistulous tracts after tubal surgery, are the cause of REP, these defects are not always observed during surgery, and not all patients have these risk factors.Others have suggested migration along the ovarian vessels or trophoblastic erosion through the peritoneum, but there is no firm evidence to support these theories.Lastly, as in the video article by Yuan et al. (2) , the migration of the fertilized egg through the lymphatic channels has been proposed and is supported by the presence of lymphatic tissue surrounding the pregnancy detected using pathology.However, the presence of lymphatic tissue has been described in only a few number of cases.With all these theories in mind, the etiology of REP is likely multifactorial.Because this condition is very rare, the study of its mechanism is difficult, but further studies with strict reporting criteria, including the description of the presence of peritoneal defects, erosion, endometriosis, or lymphatic tissue, may help tease out a dominant theory. Another key consideration in the study of REP is the difficulty of diagnosis.The rates of the misdiagnosis of REP are high, with 70% of patients not receiving an accurate diagnosis on their initial visit.Furthermore, 54% of patients with misdiagnosis received unwarranted invasive treatment, with 46% of the cases receiving R2 treatments (3).Although there is no consensus on the diagnosis and treatment of REP, recommendations can be made based on previous cases.The key findings that would point one toward the direction of REP are abdominal pain, high initial Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin levels, and the absence of pregnancy visualized in the uterine cavity or adnexa.The primary imaging modalities include ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, with the identification of a retroperitoneal mass.The treatment options include direct methotrexate injection and retroperitoneal pregnancy resection.Further evaluation of these treatment options and others, including systemic methotrexate administration and potassium chloride injection, are necessary, given that case reports have shown treatment failure with systemic treatment (4).In the case by Yuan et al. (2) , REP was identified using ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging and removed via laparoscopic resection, with an instructional video to illustrate their technique.Video demonstrations such as this can provide important information on the surgical technique for rare conditions such as REP.Although rare, it is important to keep alternate sites of implantation for ectopic pregnancy on the differential, especially when patients present with risk factors.Looking not just in the pelvis using ultrasound but assessing alternate sites and considering additional imaging when no gestational sac is identified can help reduce unnecessary treatments and potentially save lives. Although there are still many unanswered questions with regard to REP, it is essential to continue looking behind the curtain, searching for answers that can help us better under-\\n\\n==================================================\\n\\nFile: A-call-to-action-to-reproductive-endocrinologists-.grobid.tei.json\\nTitle: A call to action to reproductive endocrinologists: we cannot avoid the culture wars\\nAuthors: Nanette [] Santoro\\nAbstract: \\nBody Text: I began life as a Catholic; however, by the age of 15 years, my permanent lapse from the Catholic church began.The main reason for my abandonment of Catholicism was its hardline stance that life begins at the moment of conception and its resulting implications.This position seemed to be dismissive of the individual who had to carry the pregnancy and care for the child.It seemed unfair to women.Further, it was problematic to me that a zygote had rights, which competed with a fully formed adult. As a 15-year-old, I had a lot of ambition and perceived many barriers to attaining my life goals.However, expectations for me were low.My parents\\' stated goal for me, communicated throughout childhood, was to complete high school without getting pregnant.I wanted more from my life.I decided to stage a coup: I applied to a 6-year BS-MD program at Rensselear Polytechnic Institute/Albany Medical College, and I got in.At the age of 17, I began my medical and scientific career.I was in the medical school by the age of 19, and by the age of 23 I was a fully minted physician.However, I never stopped pondering the concepts that led me away from Catholicism and led me toward a career in obstetrics and gynecology and then to a fellowship in reproductive endocrinology.I now deal with the very early stages of human life every day.It has been said that the 2 most desperate people in the world are women who are pregnant but do not wish to be pregnant and women who are not pregnant but who wish to be pregnant.This dictum has rung true certainly over my years of clinical experience. Our culture wars on abortion all but ignore the woman who is pregnant without intending to become pregnant.This mindset allows us to make proclamations on the basis of religious theory when in fact the practical, life-altering consequences of carrying a pregnancy and possibly caring for a child and nurturing that child to adulthood-a lifelong commitment-is at best a very messy process and almost always falls to the pregnant person.Although some women find themselves unintentionally pregnant, there are many women or couples who wish to conceive but cannot do so.As reproductive endocrinologists, we spend most time with women and couples in the latter situation and often consider ourselves \\'\\'exempt\\'\\' from the culture wars on abortion.We tell ourselves that we are working on the other end of the fertility conundrum, and our work has nothing to do with abortion politics.We believe that we are above the fray.This intellectual position is not only wrong but also harmful to women in several ways.First, reproductive endocrinologists are already victims of the culture wars.We relinquished the opportunity to acquire federal funding for embryo research in 1995 when the Dickey-Wicker Amendment was attached to the appropriation bill.Signed into law by the then president Bill Clinton, this amendment prohibits the Department of Health and Human Services from using National Institutes of Health funds for the creation of embryos for research.By making traditional funding opportunities unavailable for reproductive endocrinologists who wanted to study embryo biology, Dickey-Wicker effectively stifled a major line of inquiry in our field for a generation of potential physician-scientists.We do further harm by pretending that we are the \\'\\'good guys\\'\\' who help create families because this positioning ascribes value to women on the basis of their reproductive choices-the woman who chooses not to be a mother is cast as \\'\\'bad,\\'\\' and the woman who will stop at nothing to become a mother is \\'\\'good\\'\\'-an age-old dichotomy that defines women through their reproductive potential and overlooks their nonreproductive contributions to the society.Such a position further erodes the self-esteem of the woman who wishes to become pregnant but cannot because her reproductive wishes cannot be fulfilled, and she views herself as deficient.Moreover, because she is defined as a reproductive creature, the loss of this core aspect of her existence is considered a devastating loss. I would argue that avoiding the culture wars and stressing our \\'\\'proreproduction\\'\\' stance as reproductive endocrinologists is a naïve position, but regardless, that may be about to change.It is widely expected that the Supreme Court will rule in favor of a \\'\\'states\\' rights\\'\\' argument for reproductive legislation and will reverse Roe v Wade (cf Dobbs vs Jackson Women\\'s Health Orgnaization, 19-1392 [Mississippi 2018]), the landmark decision that decriminalized pregnancy termination up to the gestational age of 23 weeks, which at the time of the ruling was considered the lower limit of viability.It is also widely expected that restrictive laws-many of which are already in the works-will limit or eliminate a woman\\'s ability to terminate her pregnancy in the privacy and safety of her provider\\'s office in many states.Bounties for reporting on women who have terminated a pregnancy, restrictions on prescribing of mifepristone to facilitate a safe and private home pregnancy termination, and even criminalizing across-state travel to obtain a pregnancy termination are all on the table.Personhood amendments, which assign rights to zygotes, embryos, and fetuses, are expected to be passed in several states, with potentially draconian consequences for women. As reproductive endocrinologists, we stand a very good chance of getting caught in the crossfire of these new restrictions.As discussed in a recent Views and Reviews on this topic, frozen embryos that have \\'\\'personhood\\'\\' can complicate our current practices of embryo cryopreservation (1) (2) (3) (4) .Such legislation can result in catastrophic damages in the face of a freezer failure or laboratory error and will make it much less attractive to put embryos into long-term storage because of the fear of any unintentional mishap.Patients with missed abortions will likely become collateral damage in the abortion wars, and we may be breaking the law by providing such patients with medications to complete the miscarriage or be prosecuted for performing a uterine evacuation.Patients with heartbreaking second trimester pregnancy losses after infertility can also face prosecution if their pregnancy loss is suspected to have been intentional (5) . We need to break the silence and stand with our family planning partners to protest the religious tyranny of the antichoice doctrine.We need to further the ideal of a pluralistic society, one in which people believe in all kinds of different things and tolerate each other\\'s beliefs.We need to stop casting women into categories on the basis of their sexual and reproductive experiences and choices.We must apply our knowledge of reproductive science to public policy.In other words, we need to create a world that an ambitious 15year-old would want to inherit.

Combining two novel ligation techniques in laparoscopic myomectomy is a safe and efficient surgical choice.This technique has obvious advantages in large, broad ligament myomas, reducing bleeding and avoiding unintentional injuries, even in duplicated ureters.Furthermore, this technique is not limited by the device and does not increase the cost of surgery.(\\nBody Text: \\n\\n==================================================\\n\\nFile: A-diagnosis-of-diminished-ovarian-reserve-does-not.grobid.tei.json\\nTitle: A diagnosis of diminished ovarian reserve does not impact embryo aneuploidy or live birth rates compared to patients with normal ovarian reserve\\nAuthors: Yuval [] Fouks, Alan [] Penzias, Werner [] Neuhausser, Denis [] Vaughan, Denny [] Sakkas\\nAbstract: Objective: To estimate the aneuploidy rates in young women with diminished ovarian reserve (DOR) before treatment and poor ovarian response (POR) postretrieval.Design: Retrospective cohort study.Setting: A single academically-affiliated fertility clinic.Patient(s): Autologous frozen embryo transfer cycles from December 2014 to June 2020 were reviewed.Demographic and clinical factors that impact outcomes were used for propensity score matching (PSM) in a ratio of 2:1 and 4:1 for preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy pre-cycle DOR and POR after stimulation, respectively.Intervention(s): None.Main Outcome Measure(s): Aneuploid rates, defined as the number of aneuploid blastocysts divided by the number of biopsied blastocysts per cycle.No euploid embryos to transfer, defined as all cohorts of embryos being aneuploid.Result(s): A total of 383 women diagnosed with DOR were compared with matched controls.Aneuploid rates did not differ significantly between the two groups (42.2% vs. 41.7%;RR ¼ 1.06; 95% CI, 0.95-1.06).No differences were identified in live birth rates per transfer between women with and without DOR after euploid single-embryo transfers (56.0% and 60.5%, respectively).An additional PSM analysis to assess aneuploidy rates for patients with POR (<5 oocytes) vs. those without it, resulted in similar rates of aneuploidy between the two comparison groups (41.1% vs. 44%, R ¼ 1.02; 95% CI, 0.91-1.14).The prevalence of cycles with \\'\\'no euploid embryos\\'\\' in the POR cohort was higher (26% vs. 13%); however, rates of cases with a single embryo available for biopsy were lower in the DOR group, relative to controls (11% vs. 31%). Young women diagnosed with DOR or POR exhibited equivalent aneuploidy rates and live birth rates per euploid embryo transfer in a large matched population, based on age, body mass index, and IVF cycle initiation.The lower percentage of cycles with no euploid embryo available for transfer in DOR and POR patients is because of the decreased total number of oocytes/developing embryos and not because of increased aneuploidy rates in these groups.(\\nBody Text: espite extensive research, it is still unclear whether patients with DOR show poor reproductive outcomes because of their lower ovarian response or additional qualitative oocyte morbidity which could translate to more genetically unbalanced embryos or other egg factors affecting the developmental potential.Embryonic aneuploidy results from several types of chromosomal segregation errors (1, 2) , and affects an exceptionally high number of human conceptions, causing infertility, miscarriages, and congenital disorders.These segregation errors have distinct age dependencies that directly impact the human reproductive lifespan (3) .Because age, chromosomal oocyte errors, and ovarian response are intertwined, the assessment of the rate of chromosomally unbalanced embryos in patients with diminished ovarian reserve (DOR) is inherently confounded.Subsequently, conflicting results have been published from previous studies trying to control for these confounding factors (3) (4) (5) . Few recent studies have stated that the diagnosis of DOR was associated with reduced oocyte quality (6) .Diminished ovarian reserve has been also reported to be associated with inferior embryo morphology scores and an increase in pregnancy loss in other studies (7) (8) (9) (10) .Contrary to this, other authors have reported no association between aneuploidy rates and DOR (11) (12) (13) .Therefore, it remains unclear whether a premature reduction of the ovarian reserve in younger patients is also associated with a premature reduction in oocyte quality and increased embryo aneuploidy rates.Moreover, patient counseling in cases of DOR and poor ovarian response (POR) is lacking evidence relative to the validity of pre-cycle ovarian markers (anti-m€ ullerian hormone [AMH], antral follicle count [AFC] ) in affecting aneuploidy rates (14) .The lack of clarity could be aided by improved matching methods to define a clearer comparative group and to avoid confounding by significant age differences.Propensity score methods (PSM) preserve the study base by allowing more cases to be used and therefore avoid the selection bias, often caused by either nonsimilar or incomplete sampling-frame coverage (15) . In this study, we have performed a comparison of aneuploidy rates, based on PSM using a large retrospective data set of patients <40 years of age diagnosed with DOR and POR to stimulation.The preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT-A) platform was based on next-generation sequencing in all cases.Additionally, we compared live birth rates per transferred embryo and the rate of \\'\\'all aneuploid embryos\\'\\' in these patients relative to controls, as this rate was previously reported to be higher in patients with DOR and recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) (16) . Clinical data were extracted at an academically-affiliated fertility clinic, Boston IVF, Waltham, Massachusetts.We included all women undergoing autologous in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment who had their first oocyte retrieval from December 2014 to December 2020 and were scheduled to have blastocyst biopsy for PGT-A.Couples with no infertility diagnosis in the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology (SART) reported categories were excluded.The study protocol was reviewed and deemed exempt by the Institutional Review Board at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (protocol number 2019-P-001107). The patients included in the analyses were %40 years of age, corresponding with the most common DOR definitions (17) and providing a prognostic tool to younger women facing DOR and POR.Two comparisons were made to assess aneuploidy in these patients: in the first analysis, DOR was assigned by fertility specialists during the first medical encounter using a pre-cycle assessment of AFC, folliclestimulating hormone (FSH), and AMH.Each case of a physician-reported DOR was additionally validated by data extraction from the medical charts and a maximum AMH cut-off of 1.1 ng/mL for DOR was set.A family risk factor for primary ovarian insufficiency was not a standalone criterion for including patients in the DOR group (study group).The PSM control group for this comparison consisted of non-DOR patients with other SART-reported diagnoses for infertility.The second analysis was a comparison between patients with POR during ovarian stimulation at the fresh IVF cycle, defined as the cohort of patients with <5 retrieved oocytes (study group) and a non-POR control group (R5 oocytes). All patients underwent ovarian stimulation, oocyte retrieval, and embryo transfers following all standard protocols at the physician\\'s discretion; the most frequently used protocol was the standard antagonist protocol.Final oocyte maturation was triggered using either human chorionic gonadotropin, leuprolide acetate, or a combination of the two.Oocyte retrieval was typically performed 36 hours after the trigger.Most oocytes underwent conventional insemination, with 33.6% of cycles using intracytoplasmic sperm injection.Before embryo transfers, patients followed a standard protocol and received luteal support by either vaginal or intramuscular progesterone supplementation. Thaw cycles were performed after blastocyst vitrification on the fifth or sixth day.Frozen embryos were transferred on the fifth day using the luteal support regimens previously published by Vaughan et al. (18, 19) . Preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy protocols were previously published (20, 21) .Testing was performed by a trophectoderm biopsy on all embryos between stages 3 and 6 with grade A or B inner cell mass and trophectoderm.Since 2014, we have used next-generation sequencing platforms uniformly, and over 85% of biopsies have been analyzed and interpreted by 3 commercial genetic laboratories, while the remaining biopsies have been examined by a few smaller laboratories.Embryos were deemed euploid or aneuploid, according to the laboratory cut-off values. Notably, during the study period, it was a clinical practice not to report embryo mosaicism.Embryos deemed euploid by PGT-A were transferred during subsequent thaw cycles. The primary outcome was the aneuploid rate, defined as the number of genetically unbalanced blastocysts divided by the total number of blastocysts biopsied in one treatment cycle (aneuploid/biopsied embryos).Aneuploid rates were compared after PSM between DOR and non-DOR patients and between POR and non-POR patients, respectively. Outcomes of interest included embryo transfer, the number of embryos transferred, clinical pregnancies, ectopic pregnancies, biochemical pregnancies, miscarriages, and live births.An additional outcome of interest was the rate of \\'\\'No euploid for transfer\\'\\' when all embryos from a single oocyte retrieval were aneuploid.We have chosen this outcome because this rate was previously reported to be higher in patients with DOR and RPL (16) . Propensity score matching was performed to adjust for confounders related to aneuploidy.To achieve this, the propensity score model included both demographic and clinical factors available to the IVF provider before PGT-A or fresh embryo transfer procedures.As patient age is the most influential factor determining the aneuploidy rate, we used age to match patients with DOR and POR with their respective control groups.We additionally used patient body mass index and the year of cycle initiation to match all cases to controls.Following the matching of the groups, we used Poisson regression analysis of aggregated data to model aneuploid rates with the total number of embryos biopsied as the offset. Statistical analysis was performed using the R statistical software (v4.1.2;R Core Team 2021 Vienna, Austria).We tested the null hypothesis for Missing Completely at Random for Sixty-three cycles with missing \\'\\'weight at cycle start,\\'\\' using Little\\'s test (P¼ .62)against the study outcome.We used the mean value across the study population to impute missing patient weight data.Continuous data were analyzed with Student\\'s t test or Mann-Whitney test for normally or nonnormally distributed data, respectively.Categorical variables were analyzed with c 2 or Fisher\\'s exact test.All tests were two-sided and P< .05 was considered significant. Propensity score analysis was performed using the \\'\\'MatchIt\\'\\' package to match patients diagnosed with DOR and POR using nearest neighbor matching. The study population from the initially identified cohort to the final analysis groups is shown in the study flowchart (Fig. 1 ).Our original cohort contained 2,219 patients <40 years of age in their first IVF cycle, of these 383 patients were diagnosed with DOR and 143 with POR according to the aforementioned criteria. The first comparison consisted of patients with and without DOR.The study and control groups were matched in a 1:2 ratio, with 764 women with non-DOR etiologies as controls for 383 patients with DOR.The propensity score frequencies and their group distributions among women in the study and control groups are shown in Supplemental Figure 1 (available online).The mean time couples attempted to conceive did not differ between the two groups (14.1 AE 16.0 vs. 13.3AE 16.1 months). The patient characteristics in the DOR and non-DOR groups before and after PSM are represented in Tables 1 and 2 .Before applying PSM, the aneuploidy rate in a given stimulation cycle between the DOR and non-DOR groups was 42.2% vs. 39.1%,respectively.The aneuploidy rate in a given stimulation cycle between DOR and non-DOR groups did not differ significantly after applying PSM (42.2% vs. 41.7%;P¼ .87,RR ¼ 1.06; 95% CI, 0.95-1.06).A significantly greater mean gonadotropin dose was used for the DOR group.The average ovarian reserve markers, after PSM matching, in the study and control groups before the cycle started were 0.91 ng/mL AE 0.76 and 3.6 ng/mL AE 3.0 for AMH (P< .001;95% CI, 2.39-3.00)and 6.4 AE 6.4 and 10.1 AE 6.6 (P< .001;95% CI, 2.88-4.43)for AFC, respectively.More oocytes were retrieved in the non-DOR group (P< .001). For the second comparison of POR vs. non-POR groups, a 1:4 ratio was used, resulting in 143 and 572 patients with POR and without POR, respectively.The characteristics of the groups before and after PSM are represented in Supplemental Tables 1 and 2 .A higher mean number of blastocysts were available for biopsy in POR than in the non-POR group (2.2 AE 1.0 vs. 6.8AE 4.4; P< .001).Similarly, fertilization rates were lower in the POR group (3.0 AE 1.0 vs. 10.2AE 5.7; P>.001; 95% CI, 8. 16-6.25) . The aneuploidy rate in a given stimulation cycle between the groups did not differ (41.1% vs. 44.0%;P¼ .75,RR of 1.02; 95% CI, 0.91-1.14). Figure 2 shows the aneuploidy rates of the matched cohort by AMH levels.In this case the AMH level was divided into 3 groups by percentiles: 25th percentile (R0.9 ng/mL); 25 to 75th percentile (>0.9 ng/mL and <3.5 ng/mL); and 75th percentile (R3.5 ng/mL).The ploidy rates did not differ significantly between the 3 AMH groups. The characteristics and fertility outcomes of singleembryo transfers of a euploid blastocyst in the subsequent frozen-thawed cycle in the DOR, POR, and control groups are shown in Supplemental Tables 3 and 4 .The number of women with no euploid embryos to transfer differed significantly between the DOR and POR groups vs. controls (19.3% vs. 10.3%;P< .001) and (26.5% and 13.2%; P< .001),respectively.However, rates of only 1 embryo available for biopsy were significantly lower in both DOR and POR Boxplot display of the euploidy rate per cohort of biopsied blastocysts by antim€ ullerian hormone (AMH) levels: 25th percentile (R0.97 ng/mL); 75 to 25th percentile (>0.97 ng/mL and % 3.56 ng/mL); 75th percentile (>3.56 ng/mL). Fouks.Embryo ploidy in DOR.Fertil Steril 2022. groups relative to controls (31%, n ¼ 120, vs. 11%, n ¼ 89, respectively).Live birth rates and other fertility outcomes were not statistically different between the DOR and non-DOR groups (60.6% vs. 56.1%)and the POR and non-POR groups (64.1% vs. 54.1%),respectively. We found that the aneuploidy rates of blastocysts for women with DOR, based on pre-cycle medical evaluations, or POR, based on ovarian response during the cycle, did not have an increased risk of aneuploidy compared with women with normal ovarian reserve and response, respectively.Based on this, we conclude that the depletion of the follicular reserve <40 years of age is not significantly associated with a concurrent increase in the fraction of embryos deemed aneuploid by PGT. Our results indicate that, for patients diagnosed with DOR, who have achieved blastocyst stage, the chance of having euploid embryos is similar to the general infertile population.Additionally, we show that the developmental potential of a euploid blastocyst is similar in DOR patients and controls, indicating that other factors (besides aneuploidy) that may affect egg quality do not differ between these groups.Thus, the true rate-limiting factor for achieving a live birth for these patients would be the extent of their ovarian response to stimulation during a cycle.Patients should be duly informed and reassured that cycles without any euploid embryo for transfer are associated with their lower ovarian response and not with qualitative reduction.Our study did not assess the efficacy of PGT-A in becoming an adjunct to routine treatment.We acknowledge that PGT-A is commonly used in a wide array of patients, but we neither endorse nor refute its utility in our article. Recent evidence indicates that women with DOR have limited success rates in achieving live births through IVF treatments (22) as these patients have a POR, cycle invalidations, and lower pregnancy rates.Currently, there is no uniformly accepted definition of DOR (5) , and there is a vibrant debate regarding the extent of unbalanced embryos in these populations.Studies examining DOR patients who underwent IVF as a uniform group have yielded contrasting results (3, 4) but the association between oocyte quantity and quality is not well established. According to some studies, a premature low ovarian reserve is associated with aneuploidy to varying degrees (23) (24) (25) , which might suggest a biological link between chromosome segregation and follicular depletion.Correlations of different attributes, such as oocyte and embryo morphology, rates of aneuploidy in PGT or products of conception (20, 8, 9) , and miscarriage rate (10, 11) have been tested in several studies supporting this finding.The study by Katz-Jaffe et al. (5) was one of the first to use chromosome screening to address this issue.In this study, aneuploidy rates in DOR patients were increased.However, patients in the DOR group were older than the patients in the control group.Additionally, the PGT screening was done under strict environments and was not broadly implemented throughout all infertility diagnoses, making the control group different from the actual population seeking IVF treatment.Researchers have attempted to challenge the paradigm of reduced egg quality of patients with DOR in other studies and have based their conclusions on examining AMH and FSH levels before IVF treatment, ovarian response to stimulation, and other potential surrogates of the ongoing cycle (9, 26) . The differences in these results may be viewed in light of several key factors, such as different outcome measures, various aneuploidy screen platforms, and advancements in the PGT technique.It is also possible that the different outcomes from different centers stem from differences in the underlying demographic factors and pathologies that reside under the broad and heterogeneous definition of DOR. Previous studies were limited by several confounders, such as the impact of age on ovarian response to stimulation, ploidy rates, and fertility outcomes.First, many prior studies lack specific details regarding the ovarian reserve markers AMH and AFC (27) .Second, in several studies, the ovarian response parameters in the DOR group, such as the number of oocytes retrieved and total metaphase II oocytes, were higher than expected.The subsequent studies might partially reflect some better prognosis populations that were included in the DOR category.Third, the heterogeneity of using a mixed variety of different PGT-A analysis methods, such as a single nucleotide polymorphism array, comparative genomic hybridization, and next-generation sequencing, could affect the results.In a previous study (6) , which had employed different methodologies, the euploid call rates varied by platform and were subsequently adjusted.In contrast, our study is the first study to be uniformly based on nextgeneration sequencing-only platforms.Lastly, embryo ploidy in DOR or POR patients to stimulation has been assessed using a group-matching analysis in some previous studies.The group-matching procedure has certain limitations, as some subjects cannot be matched on every level, and more subjects are required in each subgroup in this matching technique than with specific matches.On the contrary, PSM is a more tailored subject-matching process by which the risk of individual differences affecting results between the conditions is reduced.Therefore, we sought to separate age-related reduction in oocyte quality by capturing a diverse pool of patients into a PSM cohort while reducing significant bias. Overall, our primary results disagree with the conclusions of a recent study by Jaswa et al. (6) , in which blastocysts from women with DOR were reported to be less likely euploid, which might have resulted because of different study populations and the statistical methodological differences between our studies.First, we excluded women >40 years of age from the analysis, as our interest group consisted of younger patients.This is also in line with recommended criteria for assessing DOR patients (28, 29) .With the use of the SART age group classification to match the ages of patients with DOR and controls, Jaswa et al. (6) reported that the composite average euploid rate in women with DOR and non-DOR differed significantly.However, the overall age group differences in their cohort also differed (39.5 and 37.0; P< .01).In contrast, these changes were not reported as significant in a subgroup comparison, and similar aneuploidy rates were reported in their peers in the SART age groups, specifically in groups A and B, in patients<37 years of age.Our findings regarding aneuploidy rates in patients<40 years of age in both DOR and POR patients, are consistent with these results, in accordance with those found by Morin et al. (4) .Other methodological differences were using the Bologna criteria for the diagnosis of DOR by Jaswa et al. (15) and the inclusion of patients naive to previous IVF cycles.Hence, we could not use the previous POR criteria (17) .Shahine et al. (16) recently found a significantly higher rate of aneuploid embryos together with a higher rate of cycles with \\'\\'no euploid embryos\\'\\' to transfer in DOR patients with unexplained RPL compared with control patients with normal ovarian reserve.However, the cohort of patients with RPL in that study is clinically different from our study population and likely represents a subgroup of DOR patients with higher aneuploidy rates compared with a general cohort of DOR patients.Similar to Shahine et al. ( 16), we have also observed an increased rate of \\'\\'no euploid embryos\\'\\' to transfer in both the DOR and POR groups, which might be because of the overall reduction in developing embryos in these groups. Our study displays a number of strengths and limitations.First, as a retrospective study, based on data extraction of more than 6 years, the possibility of unaccounted attributes like yearly comparison as part of the PSM approach, variability between study and control group, and major shifts in one group might have limited the fertility outcomes.Second, our study included only those cycles having at least 1 blastocyst worthy of biopsy, which could misrepresent the fertility outcomes of the general DOR population, making the reported fertility outcomes relevant solely to those DOR patients who reach this stage.However, the comparable blastulation rates in DOR patients and controls indicate that the number of arrested embryos in our cohort that were not included in our analysis was similar in both the groups.An additional limitation is that data on embryo mosaicism were not reported to our clinic, indicating that some embryos might have been misclassified.However, such misclassification is expected to be small and should be equal in both groups.Finally, we chose to restrict our analyses to the first embryo transfer because the decision to use PGT-A in subsequent retrieval cycles is likely influenced by several factors, such as the outcome of previous cycles, the experience of the patient during other cycles, and the procedural costs.Because many of these factors were not available in our data set, we were unable to adequately control these confounding factors in subsequent egg retrieval cycles. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that DOR patients undergoing their first IVF cycle and those recognized as poor responders to ovarian stimulation show a similar rate of aneuploidy in blastocysts compared with women with a standard ovarian reserve and response, respectively.Once a euploid embryo is transferred, its developmental potential to achieve a live birth is not impacted by the DOR or POR diagnosis.Low pre-cycle AMH and AFC levels and ovarian response parameters were not associated with increased aneuploidy rates.Furthermore, our data could assist in individualized patient counseling regarding the prognosis of IVF in DOR patients.

One of the long-standing questions of IVF over the years has been the following: \\'\\'are more eggs better?\\'\\'Numerous studies have investigated the relationship between the number of oocytes retrieved during ovarian stimulation and live birth outcomes.These studies have generally focused on either the fresh embryo transfer live birth rate (LBR) or cumulative LBR, which accounts for live birth outcomes from fresh transfers and all subsequent frozen embryo transfers (FETs).When considering the fresh embryo transfer LBR, it has been suggested that optimal outcomes are achieved when retrieving between 6 and 15 oocytes, with <6 oocytes retrieved resulting in a lower fresh LBR and >15 oocytes retrieved resulting in either a plateau (1, (4) (5) (6) or moderate decline (7, 8) in the fresh LBR.When considering the cumulative LBR, studies have generally reported a positive trend where more oocytes result in a higher cumulative LBR, with no apparent detriment to retrieving a high number of oocytes (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) . Although some studies suggest that \\'\\'more eggs are better\\'\\' when considering live birth potential from all retrieved oocytes, this has not been definitively established using a large data set representing a diverse population.Moreover, the IVF techniques have significantly changed over the past decade with embryo culture to the blastocyst stage, more reliable cryopreservation, freeze-all cycles, and preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) (14) .There is a need to continue to establish the relationship between oocytes retrieved and live birth outcomes, ideally on a large data set that reflects the current practices of IVF.Therefore, we set out to investigate this topic using the latest data (from 2014 to 2019) from the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology Clinic Outcome Reporting System (SART CORS) database.To reflect the shift toward more freeze-all cycles, the SART CORS now defines \\'\\'primary\\'\\' embryo transfers as the first transfer that occurs after retrieval (whether fresh or frozen-thawed) and \\'\\'secondary\\'\\' embryo transfers as any subsequent frozen-thawed embryo transfers.Accordingly, the most relevant LBR metrics to patients currently are the primary transfer LBR, to capture the chances of success on the first transfer, and cumulative LBR, to capture the chances of success should they continue treatment after the primary transfer. The primary goal of this study was to determine whether a high number of oocytes retrieved during ovarian stimulation increase the chances of live birth.To this end, we investigated the association between the number of oocytes and fertilized oocytes (2PNs), blastocysts, primary transfer LBR, and cumulative LBR using a large national data set of retrieval cycles and linked FETs from the SART CORS.Furthermore, we stratified the primary transfer LBR by fresh transfers, PGT frozen transfers, and non-PGT frozen transfers. This study was conducted after the research protocol approved by WCG IRB (study no.1308073) and the SART Research Committee. This was a retrospective study using autologous IVF retrieval cycles (IVF, oocyte banking, and embryo banking cycles) and linked FETs from IVF clinics in the United States between 2014 and 2019.The data used for this study were obtained from the SART CORS.Data were collected through voluntary submission, verified by the SART, and reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in compliance with the Fertility Clinic Success Rate and Certification Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-493).The SART maintains Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant business associate agreements with reporting clinics.In 2004, after a contract change with the CDC, the SART gained access to the SART CORS data system for the purposes of conducting research.In 2017, 82% of all assisted reproductive technology clinics in the United States were SART members (15) . The data in the SART CORS are validated annually with 7%-10% of clinics receiving on-site visits for chart review on the basis of an algorithm for clinic selection.During each visit, data reported by the clinic were compared with information recorded in patients\\' charts.In 2019, records for 2,014 cycles at 34 clinics were randomly selected for full validation, along with 213 fertility preservation cycles selected for partial validation.The full validation included review of 1,300 cycles for which a pregnancy was reported.Nine of 11 data fields selected for validation were found to have discrepancy rates of %5% (15) .The exceptions were the diagnosis field, which, depending on the diagnosis, had a discrepancy rate between 2.5% and 17.8%, and the start date, which had a discrepancy rate of 8.4%.Obstetric outcomes from Massachusetts assisted reproductive technology records during 2004-2008 have been validated to have >95% agreement with vital records (16) . A total of 1,283,131 retrieval cycles and FETs were retrieved from the SART CORS database.Retrieval cycles were excluded from analysis if they were missing baseline anti-m€ ullerian hormone (AMH) or body mass index (BMI).Cancelled cycles where egg retrieval was not attempted were also excluded.Furthermore, cycles where the number of 2PNs exceeded the number of oocytes retrieved were excluded.In total, 402,411 retrieval cycles were included in the study, from 296,409 patients.For retrieval cycles with blastocyst-stage embryo transfers (n ¼ 173,066), the number of total blastocysts was calculated as the sum of the number of transferred and frozen embryos. The cumulative LBR was calculated on a per-retrieval basis and was defined as at least 1 live birth from all linked embryo transfers (i.e., accounting only for the first live birth associated with a retrieval).All linked embryo transfers were included in the cumulative LBR calculation regardless of how long the transfer occurred after retrieval, and both cleavage-stage and blastocyst-stage embryo transfers were included.This estimate of the cumulative LBR is conservative because it does not account for any unused frozen embryos.Oocyte and embryo banking retrievals without a fresh transfer or any linked FETs were excluded from this analysis (6.7% of all retrievals).The primary transfer LBR was calculated on a per-retrieval basis and was defined as a live birth from the first embryo transfer associated with the retrieval.Most primary transfers were transfers of a single embryo; however, transfers of >1 embryo were also included.We also reported the primary transfer LBR on a per-transfer basis, stratified into fresh primary transfers (n ¼ 156,581), frozen primary transfers with PGT (n ¼ 79,329), and frozen primary transfers without PGT (n ¼ 42,959).The stratified primary transfer LBR values were reported on a per-transfer basis because it was often unclear whether the intended primary transfer would have been fresh or frozen for patients without any available embryos. The relationships between the number of oocytes retrieved and the number of 2PNs and blastocysts were assessed using the Pearson correlation and by computing the least-squares best fit.The cumulative and primary transfer LBRs were calculated per the number of oocytes in the associated retrieval.Cumulative LBR calculations were further stratified by the standardized SART patient age groups (<35, 35-37, 38-40, 41-42, and >42 years), AMH quartiles (%1.0, 1.0-2.0,2.0-3.9, and >3.9), BMI groups (%18.5, 18.5-25, 25-30, and >30 kg/m 2 ), and infertility diagnoses (Supplemental Table 1 , available online).On each graph, data points calculated with fewer than 100 cycles were removed to reduce noise and improve visualization.To assess the relationship between the number of oocytes retrieved and LBR metrics, the multivariate mixed-effects logistic regression models were trained using the categorical values of oocytes retrieved, patient age, BMI, AMH, and infertility diagnoses (Supplemental Table 1 ) as the predictor variables and the cumulative and primary transfer LBRs as the response variables.Mixed-effects modeling was used to account for patients with repeated cycles.To match the SART CORS live birth prediction model (17) , age was categorized as 18-29, 30-34, 35-37, 38-39, 40-44, and 45-59 years, and BMI was categorized as %18.4,18.5-24.9,25.0-29.9,30.0-34.9, 35.0-39.9,40.0-44.9,45.0-49.9, and R50.0 kg/m 2 .The odds ratios with 95% Wald confidence intervals were computed from the fitted coefficients to estimate the effect of oocytes retrieved on the cumulative and primary transfer LBRs while controlling for patient age, BMI, AMH, and infertility diagnoses. Supplemental Table 1 summarizes the patient demographics and cycle information for cycles included in the study.Supplemental Table 2 summarizes the IVF cycle types, stratified by year of treatment start.Among all primary transfers (i.e., first transfer after retrieval), the percentage of frozen embryo primary transfers increased from 21% in 2014 to 58% in 2019.Among all retrievals, the percentage of retrievals in which PGT was performed on at least 1 embryo increased from 16% in 2014 to 50% in 2019.There were 1,975 retrieval cycles with reported moderate OHSS and 416 retrieval cycles with reported severe OHSS.The percent of cycles with OHSS decreased from 1.2% in 2014 to 0.34% in 2019.Across all retrievals, 6.7% were embryo banking cycles with no attempted embryo transfer (n ¼ 16,849).Supplemental Table 3 summarizes the number of cycles in each oocyte group used for the statistical analyses as well as the total number of live births for each oocyte group. Across all retrieval cycles, including embryo banking cycles, there was a strong positive linear correlation between oocytes and 2PNs (r ¼ 0.86, P< .01)and between oocytes and blastocysts (r ¼ 0.85, P< .01)(Fig. 1 ).On average across all patients, 63.1% of oocytes developed into 2PNs, and 32.4% of oocytes developed into blastocysts. The primary transfer LBR per retrieval increased with the number of oocytes retrieved until approximately 16-20 oocytes, at which point it began to plateau (Fig. 2 and Supplemental Table 4 ).The primary transfer LBR per transfer was stratified by fresh transfers, frozen transfers without PGT, and frozen transfers with PGT (Fig. 2 ).For fresh transfers, the primary transfer LBR increased until approximately 15 oocytes, at which point it plateaued.The primary transfer LBR was lower for fresh transfers than for frozen transfers without PGT.Frozen primary transfers with PGT had the highest primary transfer LBR, especially at lower oocyte yields, and only increased moderately with the number of oocytes retrieved.For fresh transfers, using 11-15 oocytes retrieved as a reference group, the odds ratio of live birth showed a statistically significant decrease (P< .01)at the 2 lowest groups (0-5 and 6-10 oocytes retrieved), remained close to 1 between 16 and 30 oocytes, and had a statistically significant decrease (.01<P< .05) between 31 and 40 oocytes (Table 1 ).For frozen transfers, the odds ratio increased with each successive oocyte group until 26-30 oocytes retrieved for non-PGT transfers and until 16-20 oocytes retrieved for PGT transfers (Table 1 ). The cumulative LBR per-retrieval cycle increased with the number of oocytes retrieved (Fig. 2 and Supplemental Table 4 ).The cumulative LBR increased rapidly to approximately 16-20 oocytes, at which point it continued to increase but with diminishing returns.The increasing trend of the Linear correlations between oocytes retrieved (x-axis) and fertilized oocytes (2PNs, normally fertilized oocytes) and blastocysts (y-axis). There was a strong positive linear correlation between oocytes and 2PNs (r ¼ 0.86, P<.01) and between oocytes and blastocysts (r ¼ 0.85, P<.01). Fanton.More eggs lead to higher birth rates.Fertil Steril 2023. cumulative LBR was still observed for all groups when stratifying patients by age, AMH, BMI, and infertility diagnoses (Fig. 3 ).Multivariate logistic regression also showed an increase in the cumulative LBR with oocytes retrieved.Using 11-15 oocytes retrieved as a reference group, the odds ratio of live birth on the basis of the oocyte group increased with each successive oocyte group up to 36-40 oocytes (Table 1 ).Model coefficients were statistically significant (P< .05)for all oocyte groups. In this study, we determined whether a high number of oocytes retrieved during ovarian stimulation increase the chances of live birth.Using recent data between 2014 and 2019 from the SART CORS, we found that the primary transfer LBR plateaued but did not substantially decrease with higher oocyte yields, whereas the cumulative LBR increased with the number of oocytes retrieved.Furthermore, the strong linear correlations between oocytes and 2PNs/blastocysts indicate that the mean conversion rates from oocytes to 2PNs and oocytes to blastocysts do not decline at high oocyte yields.Together, these results suggest that a high number of oocytes retrieved is associated with an improved cumulative LBR and is not associated with an inherent reduction in oocyte quality. Studies have shown that the cumulative LBR increases with an increasing number of oocytes retrieved (9-13).Retrieving more oocytes allows for additional opportunities to continue treatment, which leads to higher cumulative success rates (18) .This study confirms this finding across a large national data set that reflects the current trends of IVF in the United States with the increased prevalence of blastocyst-stage culture, freeze-all cycles, and PGT.It has been hypothesized that there is a limit to the number of follicles that can be stimulated to produce high-quality oocytes and retrieving too many eggs may be detrimental to oocyte quality (7) .However, our data do not support this theory, given the strong linear correlation between oocytes and 2PNs and between oocytes and blastocysts, even at high oocyte yields.After stratifying patients by age, AMH, BMI, and infertility diagnoses, we found that the cumulative LBR increases with the number of oocytes retrieved for all groups (Fig. 3 ).However, age was also a key factor for determining the cumulative LBR.For example, patients aged >40 years had a cumulative LBR well under 40%, even when retrieving a large number of oocytes. To maximize the fresh transfer LBR, studies have argued that there is an optimal range between 6 and 15 oocytes (1, (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) .However, we found that the fresh primary transfer LBR was highest between 11 and 30 oocytes.Our results also suggest that retrieving between 6 and 10 oocytes and 31 and 40 oocytes would result in a primary transfer LBR slightly lower than the optimal range (odds ratios between 0.83 and 0.88).However, given that <1% of cycles in the data set had more than 30 oocytes retrieved and a fresh transfer (Supplemental Table 3 ), the slight decrease in the primary transfer LBR for the 31-40 oocyte groups may not be relevant for most patients.The observed increase in the fresh primary transfer LBR up to 30 oocytes is consistent with studies using the SART CORS data from 2005 to 2010 (19) and from 2014 to 2015 (20) .The success rates for fresh primary transfers were lower than those for frozen primary transfers without PGT, which could be an effect of elevated estradiol levels or could reflect the fact that fresh transfers may be more common for lower-prognosis patients.Frozen primary transfers with PGT had the highest success rates, which were similar to the previously reported birth rates for euploid embryo transfers (21) .The increase in the number of cycles with PGT between 2014 and 2019 could be due to the shift toward freeze-all cycles and the relatively high success rates of euploid embryo transfers (Supplemental Table 2 ). The primary transfer and cumulative LBRs were calculated on a per-retrieval basis.The primary transfer LBR was Fanton.More eggs lead to higher birth rates.Fertil Steril 2023.also reported on a per-transfer basis when stratified into fresh, frozen with PGT, and frozen without PGT because it was often unclear whether the intended primary transfer would have been fresh or frozen for patients without any available embryos.The analysis of the per-transfer primary transfer LBR helps to answer the question of whether oocyte quality is impaired when higher numbers of oocytes are retrieved.The analysis of the per-retrieval cumulative LBR, which included nonbanking cycles without attempted embryo transfers (e.g., because of insufficient embryos or no normal PGT results), provides an assessment of the overall benefit to live birth outcomes as higher numbers of oocytes are retrieved. The findings of this study have important implications for other studies that focus on laboratory outcomes, such as eggs retrieved, mature oocytes, 2PNs, or blastocysts, especially when data on the cumulative LBR are not available.For example, several studies have used laboratory outcomes to evaluate the efficacy of techniques and protocols for ovarian stimulation.The efficacy of fertility preservation in patients with cancer has been assessed using oocytes retrieved (22, 23) , and the effect of stimulation protocols has been assessed using oocytes, 2PNs, and blastocysts (24, 25) .More recently, artificial intelligence tools have been assessed for their ability to optimize the timing of trigger and maximize the number of mature oocytes (26, 27) or 2PNs (28) .This study helps establish that increasing the number of oocytes does, indeed, increase the cumulative LBR, and focusing on these laboratory outcomes may be a suitable surrogate when data on the cumulative LBR are not available. It has been reported that the rate of OHSS increases significantly when retrieving more than 15-18 oocytes (1, 5).In the SART CORS data set, we found that the reported rate of moderate and severe OHSS increased with the number of oocytes (Supplemental Table 4 ), from <0.1% for retrievals with <5 oocytes to 3.1% (moderate OHSS) and 1.3% (severe OHSS) for retrievals with >40 oocytes.Current practices have reduced the risk of severe OHSS substantially by shifting to freeze-all cycles (29) and by using a gonadotropin-releasing hormone trigger instead of human chorionic gonadotropin (30, 31) .Indeed, the prevalence of OHSS has declined significantly in recent years, despite the slight increase in the mean number of oocytes retrieved, and severe OHSS has been reduced to fewer than 0.05% of all cycles reported to the SART CORS in 2019 (Supplemental Table 2 ).These new strategies to reduce the risk of OHSS may make it safer to push for higher oocyte yields to improve the cumulative LBR.However, we acknowledge that OHSS may be underreported to the SART CORS.It is important to weigh the risks of OHSS against the benefits of a higher cumulative LBR during ovarian stimulation, although describing this balance of risk and benefit was not the primary goal of this study.Future studies should seek to understand how best to balance the benefits and risks of retrieving high numbers of oocytes, ideally in a patient-specific manner.Other possible considerations of high oocyte yields include fresh transfer cancellations because of elevated estradiol levels, medication costs, TABLE 1 Odds ratios for each group of oocytes retrieved, using the 11-15 oocytes retrieved as a reference. Cycle outcomes workload for embryology laboratories, and a potential increased risk of low birth weight for fresh transfers of >1 embryo (19) .This study has several strengths and makes several key novel contributions to the literature.First, our data set was one of the largest and most heterogeneous populations to have been used to establish that the cumulative LBR increases with the number of oocytes retrieved, as the SART CORS includes over 90% of all IVF cycles in the US each year.Second, this study only included recent years of data to reflect current IVF practices, increasing the present-day relevance of these findings.Additionally, this is the first study to use the SART CORS database since the designations of \\'\\'primary\\'\\' and \\'\\'secondary\\'\\' embryo transfers were introduced in 2014 and, thus, the first to show how the primary transfer LBR is associated with the number of oocytes retrieved for both fresh and frozen embryos, with and without PGT.Lastly, our results were confirmed after correcting for biases due to age, AMH, BMI, and infertility diagnoses. This study has several limitations.First, although clinics are mandated to report to the CDC, membership in the SART and reporting to the SART are voluntary.However, most clinics and cycles in the United States are reported to the SART.Because the database is retrospective and is a registry, it is possible that we were unable to control for confounders not collected in the SART CORS, which could lead to a higher expected chance of pregnancy for women with a high number of oocytes retrieved.We did not stratify the results by stimulation protocol, although we acknowledge that different protocols could affect outcomes.In addition, calculating the cumulative LBR necessitates some assumptions.It is possible that we have underestimated the cumulative LBR because future transfers may occur with embryos that are still frozen.Furthermore, multiple live births resulting from a single retrieval cycle are only counted once because the birth rate cannot go above 100% for our statistical analyses.Lastly, we note that patients were included more than once if they had multiple retrieval cycles and each retrieval cycle was handled independently in the calculation of cumulative live birth. In conclusion, this study found that a higher number of oocytes during ovarian stimulation increase the cumulative LBR without substantially impairing the primary transfer LBR or impairing the mean conversion rates from oocytes to 2PNs and oocytes to blastocysts.The fresh primary transfer LBR was highest at 11-30 oocytes retrieved and slightly decreased for 6-10 and 31-40 oocytes.These results were confirmed after controlling for age, AMH, BMI, and infertility diagnoses.Our findings suggest that ovarian stimulation strategies should be optimized for maximum oocytes retrieved while minimizing risks such as OHSS.These presented results on the primary transfer LBR, split by fresh, frozen without PGT, and frozen with PGT, may help clinicians with the choice of which type of primary transfer may be most effective for their patient.Future studies should investigate the optimal way in which to balance the risks of OHSS against the benefits of an increased cumulative LBR.

The retrospective cohort study by Stovenzky et al. ( 1) adds another nail in the coffin for the notion that AMH can predict embryonic ploidy.In their retrospective study, there was no relationship identified between AMH and the proportion of euploid, mosaic, or aneuploid embryos in the population with infertility (N ¼ 926) or the group without infertility (N ¼ 214) among women undergoing the first cycle of in vitro fertilization using trophectoderm biopsy for preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy or preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic disease.Furthermore, there was no association between AMH and a subgroup analysis of women aged <35, 35-37, or 38-39 years.The investigators concluded that AMH indicates quantitative depletion of the ovarian reserve but does not predict the ploidy status of a cohort of embryos. Of course, the AMH level has become an important test to predict the response to ovarian stimulation for oocyte retrieval.Antim€ ullerian hormone, combined with women\\'s age, is used to predict the prognosis for assisted reproduction.Additionally, it may be used to help select an optimal treatment protocol.It can be a helpful test to incorporate into the evaluation of ovulatory dysfunction.The value of the AMH level in determining the response, the \\'\\'quantity,\\'\\' is clearly demonstrated in this article. All studies have flaws and limitations, as does this one.Most who read and reflect on this study will be left with unanswered questions and a desire to know more.By examining the relationship of AMH with the \\'\\'quality\\'\\' and \\'\\'quantity\\'\\' of oocytes using a novel approach, Stovenzky et al. (1) showed that AMH does not predict embryonic ploidy.Young women with low AMH levels do not have \\'\\'bad eggs!\\'\\'\\n\\n==================================================\\n\\nFile: A-novel-approach-using-vaginal-natural-orifice-tra.grobid.tei.json\\nTitle: A novel approach using vaginal natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery to repair a symptomatic uterine isthmocele\\nAuthors: Jan [\\'F\\'] Baekelandt, Supuni [] Kapurubandara\\nAbstract: Objective: To describe the first case of using a vaginal natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery approach to repair a uterine isthmocele.Design: Stepwise explanation of the surgical technique using original video footage.This study was exempted from requiring hospital Institutional Review Board approval.Setting: Hospital.Patient(s): A 30-year-old (gravida 2, para 2) patient presented with symptoms of intermenstrual bleeding and secondary subfertility following 2 uncomplicated cesarean section deliveries (elective for breech and repeat).The patient had a transvaginal ultrasound (US) demonstrating an isthmocele with a defect of 8.1 Â 7.0 mm with a myometrial thickness of 2 mm over the defect and proceeded to undergo surgery because of persistent symptoms.Intervention(s): An anterior vaginal incision is made on the cervix from the 3 o\\'clock to 9 o\\'clock position after local anesthetic and adrenaline infiltration of the tissue.The vaginal epithelium was carefully dissected cephalad, although an attempt was made to maintain the uterovesical space and fold.A small (7 cm) V-path gel port was inserted into this uterovesical space and the gel port was affixed with a port connected to an insufflation stabilization bag to minimize the pressure fluctuations within the confines of a small operative space and help maintain visualization throughout.Under endoscopic view, the site of the isthmocele was identified using an endoscopic US probe and confirmed on 2 dimensional imaging.A monopolar hook with an inbuilt aspirator and suction function was used to incise over the isthmocele with a grasper used to dissect into this space.A Hegar dilator was used to delineate the cervical canal.Once the isthmocele was excised, the defect was reinforced and obliterated with a barbed suture whereas the Hegar dilator was in place to prevent inadvertent canal occlusion during suturing.Continuous suturing took place from the cephalad to the caudal directions in 2 layers.Once hemostasis was confirmed, the gel port was removed, and the vaginal epithelium was closed with interrupted sutures using a braided absorbable suture.The perioperative course and care were uneventful with the Foley catheter being removed 3 hours after surgery.The patient was discharged within 24 hours.A follow-up organized 6 weeks after surgery demonstrated obliteration and repair of the previously detected uterine isthmocele on the pelvic US scan.The patient also reported a resolution of symptoms at this postoperative visit.Main Outcome Measure(s): N/A.Result(s): N/A.Conclusion(s): Uterine-conserving surgical approaches to an isthmocele have been described, including vaginal, hysteroscopic, and laparoscopic (with and without robotic assistance) approches and laparotomy, with no single approach deemed to be superior to the others.The\\nBody Text: Un nuevo enfoque vaginal mediante cirugía endosc opica transluminal por orificio natural para reparar un istmocele uterino sintom atico.

Uterine distension media for outpatient hysteroscopy (Review)\\nBody Text: The objective of this review is to compare the e ectiveness, tolerability, and safety of gas (carbon dioxide) and liquid (normal saline) used for uterine distension during outpatient hysteroscopy. We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility (CGF) Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO on 28 April 2021.We checked references of relevant trials and contacted study authors and experts in the field to identify additional studies.CINAHL records and ongoing trials from the trial registries were included in the CENTRAL search. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing saline with carbon dioxide, as well as RCTs comparing saline at di erent temperatures, for uterine distension in outpatient hysteroscopy done for any indication. We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane.Primary review outcomes were patient tolerability and adverse events or complications related to the distending medium.Secondary outcomes were quality of the hysteroscopic view and duration of the procedure. We included 12 RCTs (1946 women) .The quality of evidence ranged from very low to moderate: the main limitations were risk of bias due to absence of blinding due to the nature of the procedure, imprecision, and inconsistency. Analysis ruled out a clinically relevant di erence in pain scores during the procedure between saline and carbon dioxide, but the quality of evidence was low (standardised mean di erence (SMD) -0.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.17 to 0.02; 9 RCTs, N = 1705; I = 86%).This translates to di erences of 0.39 cm (lower) and 0.05 cm (higher) on a 10-cm visual analogue scale (VAS).Evidence was insu icient to show The womb is a hollow organ.A hysteroscope is an apparatus that is introduced inside the womb to see inside the cavity.If one is to see, the cavity needs to be filled with a clear substance (distension medium).This substance can be liquid (saline solution) or gas (carbon dioxide).Warming liquid to body temperature was suggested to improve patient tolerability.Each substance has benefits and side e ects, which we have compared here. We found 12 randomised controlled trials comparing distension media in a total of 1946 women undergoing outpatient hysteroscopy.Evidence is current to April 2021. Pain during the procedure may be similar with saline and carbon dioxide.We are uncertain whether saline is as tolerable as carbon dioxide in terms of proportion of procedures abandoned due to intense pain and the need to use painkillers.Saline is probably associated with fewer side e ects than carbon dioxide.Saline may be superior to carbon dioxide in terms of quality of the hysteroscopic view.Evidence is inconclusive for duration of the procedure. Compared to room temperature saline, warm saline may reduce pain scores.Evidence is inconclusive for other outcomes in this comparison. Mean (SD) pain score during the procedure was 2.74 (2.3) cm on 10-cm VAS b SMD 0.07 SD lower (0.17 lower to 0.02 higher) 1705 (9 RCTs) ⊕⊕⊝⊝ LOW c,d This translates to a difference of 0.16 cm lower on 10-cm VAS with saline (0.39 cm lower to 0.05 cm higher) b Procedures abandoned due to intense pain 43 *The risk in the intervention group (and its 95% confidence interval) is based on the assumed risk in the comparison group and the relative effect of the intervention (and its 95% CI). The uterine cavity is a virtual space that is lined by the endometrium.There is a need to assess the uterine cavity and the endometrium in women with abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB), infertility, or suspected genital tract congenital anomalies. In addition to performing assessment, obtaining an endometrial sample may be required in some cases (Munro 2011). Several options are available to assess the inside of the uterus, including two-dimensional ultrasonography, three-dimensional ultrasonography, saline infusion sonohysterography, hysteroscopy, and magnetic resonance imaging (Bingol 2011; Farquhar 2003; Seshadri 2014) .Dilatation and curettage (D&C) was used in the past to investigate the uterine cavity and to obtain an endometrial sample.However, D&C is considered obsolete because it is a blind method with low sensitivity for local and pedunculated intracavitary lesions.Further disadvantages of D&C include the need for hospital admission and general anaesthesia (Bettocchi 2001) . Hysteroscopy involves the introduction of a lighted scope through the cervix to visualise the uterine cavity.Hysteroscopy has replaced D&C for many cases requiring investigation of the uterine cavity. With direct visualisation of the uterine cavity, organic lesions are not missed and directed biopsy can be performed (Bedner 2007; Clark 2018) .Hysteroscopy in an o ice setting was described in 1969 by Leidenheimer (Leidenheimer 1969) .He used an instrument called the Silander hysteroscope, which was originally described by Torsten Silander in 1963 (Silander 1963) .O ice hysteroscopy in general is preferable, as it o ers the advantages of being minimally invasive, can be done without general anaesthesia for diagnostic purposes, and has low cost and quick recovery time. In addition, some surgical interventions can be performed in the same setting -\\'see and treat\\' (Robinson 2013).O ice hysteroscopy has a necessary role in the diagnostic workup for heavy menstrual bleeding (NICE guidelines 2018).The \\'traditional\\' approach for hysteroscopy requires introduction of a vaginal speculum to separate vaginal walls and to visualise the cervix, followed by use of a forceps to grasp the cervix.On the other hand, the new \\'vaginoscopic\\' approach is done by guiding the hysteroscope inside the vagina that is distended by the media without the use of vaginal instruments (Cooper 2010; Smith 2019). Since this procedure was introduced, several modifications to outpatient hysteroscopy have been proposed, aimed at decreasing the associated pain and improving satisfaction for patients and operators.Decreasing the diameter of the hysteroscope (minihysteroscope < 3.5 mm) and using the no-touch \\'vaginoscopic\\' approach are examples of such modifications that may result in less pain and better tolerability of outpatient hysteroscopy (Evangelista 2011). As the uterine cavity is a virtual space, it needs to be distended by a medium under pressure if the whole cavity and the tubal ostia are to be visualised (Rioux 1984) .Currently, the media in use include gas as carbon dioxide and liquid as saline that can be used at room temperature or warmed to body temperature (Brusco 2003) . Problems linked to the type of distension media include pelvic pain, shoulder-tip pain, and endometrial bleeding.These problems can negatively influence image quality and patient satisfaction (Evangelista 2011). The search for the perfect gaseous or liquid distension media continues, as both methods o er advantages and disadvantages (Litta 2003; Nagele 1996; Paschopoulos 2004; Raimondo 2010) .This review aims to summarise the evidence for all distension media in current use. The objective of this review is to compare the e ectiveness, tolerability, and safety of gas (carbon dioxide) and liquid (normal saline) used for uterine distension during outpatient hysteroscopy. Criteria for considering studies for this review Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any uterine distension medium versus another in outpatient hysteroscopy were eligible.We excluded non-randomised and quasi-randomised trials. Women undergoing outpatient hysteroscopy for all indications were eligible for inclusion. Outpatient hysteroscopy using gas or liquid for uterine distension was eligible. We considered studies for inclusion in this review if they were appropriately designed to evaluate outcome measures relevant to patient and operator satisfaction when outpatient hysteroscopy using carbon dioxide or normal saline as a distension medium is performed. 1. Tolerability of the procedure, assessed as a. pain experienced by women during the procedure, excluding pain during introduction of the hysteroscope, based on pain scores b. proportion of procedures abandoned or terminated owing to patient pain or discomfort c. the need for analgesia 2. Operative and postoperative adverse events and complications, including shoulder-tip pain, vagal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and fainting attack), bleeding from the endometrium, and infection Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. 1. Quality of the hysteroscopic view, assessed as a. operator\\'s description of the clarity of the view on a specified scale b. proportion of procedures with an unsatisfactory hysteroscopic view 2. Length of time to complete the procedure 3. Cost implications We searched for all published and unpublished RCTs studying distension media in outpatient hysteroscopy in consultation with the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group (CGF) Information Specialist on 28 April 2021. We searched the following electronic databases for relevant trials: We handsearched the reference lists of relevant trials and systematic reviews retrieved by the search and contacted experts in the field to obtain additional trials.We also handsearched relevant journals and conference abstracts that are not covered in the CGF Specialised Register, in liaison with the Information Specialist. Ongoing trials from trial registries (clinicaltrials.govand the World Health Organization International Trials Registry Platform search portal) were included in the CENTRAL search. Titles and abstracts of search results were initially screened independently by two review authors (KSA and MB), a er which we retrieved the full texts of potentially eligible studies.Two review authors (KSA and MAG) independently examined all full-text articles and selected studies meeting the Review eligibility criteria for inclusion.When papers contained insu icient information to permit a decision about eligibility, we attempted to contact study investigators to seek further details.We resolved disagreements by discussion with a third review author (BWJM).We documented the selection process by using a PRISMA flow chart. Two review authors (KSA and MAG) independently extracted data from eligible studies using a data extraction form.We resolved disagreements by discussion.Extracted data included study characteristics and outcome data (see Characteristics of included studies tables).We collated multiple reports of the same trial under a single study ID with multiple references.We attempted to contact study investigators for further information on methods and/or results, if required.We included studies irrespective of whether outcomes were reported in a usable way.In multi-arm studies, we excluded data from arms that did not meet eligibility criteria. Two review authors (KSA and MAG) independently assessed the included studies for risk of bias using the Cochrane \\'Risk of bias\\' assessment tool (Higgins 2011).We assessed the following domains: selection bias (random sequence generation and allocation concealment); performance bias (blinding of participants and personnel); detection bias (blinding of outcome assessors); attrition bias (incomplete outcome data); reporting bias (selective reporting); and other bias.We assigned judgements as recommended in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, Section 8.5 (Higgins 2011).We resolved disagreements by discussion.We described all judgements in detail and presented our conclusions in the \\'Risk of bias\\' table in the Characteristics of included studies section.We incorporated these conclusions into our interpretation of review findings by means of sensitivity analyses (see Sensitivity analysis). For dichotomous data, we used the numbers of events in both groups of each study to calculate Peto odds ratios (Peto ORs). For continuous outcomes, we calculated mean di erences (MDs) between treatment groups when outcomes were reported with the same scale.We calculated standardised mean di erences (SMDs) when outcomes were reported on di erent scales.We reversed the direction of e ect of individual studies, when required, to ensure consistency across trials.We treated ordinal data as continuous data.We presented all outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).When data to calculate ORs and SMDs were not available, we utilised the most numerical data available (e.g.test statistics, P values).We assessed whether estimates calculated in the review for individual studies were compatible in each case with estimates reported in the study publications. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. The primary analysis was per woman randomised.Data that did not allow valid analysis were briefly summarised in an additional table and were not meta-analysed. We analysed data on an intention-to-treat basis as far as possible (i.e.including all randomised participants in analysis, in the groups to which they were randomised).Attempts were made to obtain missing data from the original trialists.We did not undertake imputation, and we analysed only available data. We considered whether the clinical and methodological characteristics of included studies were su iciently similar for meta-analysis to provide a clinically meaningful summary.We assessed statistical heterogeneity using I .We considered I greater than 50% to indicate substantial heterogeneity (Higgins 2011). In view of the di iculty of detecting and correcting for publication bias and other reporting biases, we aimed to minimise their potential impact by ensuring a comprehensive search for eligible studies and by being alert for duplication of data.We planned to use a funnel plot to explore the possibility of small-study e ects (i.e.tendency for estimates of the intervention e ect to be more beneficial in smaller studies) if 10 or more studies were included in the same analysis. If studies were su iciently similar, we combined the data using a fixed-e ect model in the following comparisons. 1. Saline versus carbon dioxide.2. Warm saline versus room temperature saline. We performed statistical analysis using Review Manager 5.3 (RevMan 2014). We included no preplanned subgroup analyses in this review. If we noted substantial heterogeneity (I > 50%), we planned to explore di erences between studies that might account for the heterogeneity.We took any statistical heterogeneity into account when interpreting the results, especially if we noted any variation in the direction of e ect. We conducted sensitivity analyses for the primary outcomes to determine whether conclusions were robust to arbitrary decisions made regarding eligibility and analysis.These analyses included consideration of whether review conclusions would have di ered if: 1. eligibility had been restricted to studies at low risk of bias, defined as studies at low risk of selection bias; 2. a random-e ects model had been adopted; or 3. risk ratio had been used as the summary e ects measure. We prepared a \\'Summary of findings\\' table using GRADEpro and Cochrane methods (GRADEpro GDT 2015; Higgins 2011) .This table evaluated the overall quality of the body of evidence for the main comparison (saline versus carbon dioxide) while addressing the review outcomes: patient tolerability (pain during the procedure, procedures abandoned due to intense pain, need for analgesia), adverse events and complications (vasovagal reaction, shoulder-tip pain, endometrial bleeding, infection), quality of the hysteroscopic view (clarity of the view on a scale, procedures with an unsatisfactory view), and duration of the procedure.An additional \\'Summary of findings\\' table was prepared for the main review outcomes for the other comparison (warm saline versus room temperature saline).We assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE criteria: risk of bias, consistency of e ect, imprecision, indirectness, and publication bias.Two review authors working independently (KSA and MAG) made judgements about evidence quality (high, moderate, low, or very low), with disagreements resolved by discussion.We justified, documented, and incorporated judgements into reporting of results for each outcome.We extracted study data, formatted our comparisons in data tables, and prepared \\'Summary of findings\\' tables before writing the results and conclusions of our review. The search yielded 730 records, in addition to two records identified through other sources.Twenty-four studies were potentially eligible and were retrieved in full text (Figure 1 ); 12 of these met our inclusion criteria (Characteristics of included studies).We excluded eight studies (Characteristics of excluded studies), and four are awaiting classification (Characteristics of studies awaiting classification). We included 12 trials in this systematic review.All studies were parallel-designed randomised controlled trials (RCTs).Of theses 12 trials, one was a conference abstract (Garbin 2000) , and the other 11 were published as full articles (Almeida 2008; Diniz 2009; Evangelista 2011; Isaat 2017; Mazzon 2014; Paschopoulos 2004; Pellicano 2003; Pluchino 2010; Raimondo 2010; Shankar 2004; Tawfek 2019) . The studies included 1946 women who had undergone outpatient hysteroscopy.Mean patient age ranged across studies from 33 to 58 years. Nine studies compared saline versus carbon dioxide as distension media for outpatient hysteroscopy (Almeida 2008; Diniz 2009; Garbin 2000; Mazzon 2014; Paschopoulos 2004; Pellicano 2003; Pluchino 2010; Raimondo 2010; Shankar 2004) .Three studies compared warm versus room temperature saline (Evangelista 2011; Isaat 2017; Tawfek 2019). The vaginoscopic approach for introducing the hysteroscope was used for both arms in eight trials (Evangelista 2011; Isaat 2017; Mazzon 2014; Paschopoulos 2004; Pellicano 2003; Pluchino 2010; Raimondo 2010; Tawfek 2019) , the traditional approach for both arms was used in two studies (Garbin 2000; Shankar 2004) , and two studies used the vaginoscopic approach for the saline group and the traditional approach for the carbon dioxide group (Almeida 2008; Diniz 2009) .Hysteroscopies with di erent outer sheath diameters ranging from 2.8 to 5.1 mm were used across studies. Saline at di erent temperatures was used in studies comparing warm saline with room temperature saline: 37.5°C in two studies (Evangelista 2011; Tawfek 2019), and 36°C in one study (Isaat 2017).One of the trials comparing saline with carbon dioxideused warm saline at 36°C (Almeida 2008). All 12 studies included in the analysis reported pain during the procedure.A standardised 10-cm visual analogue scale (VAS), with 0 indicating no pain and 10 indicating worst pain, was used to measure pain in 11 studies (Almeida 2008; Diniz 2009; Evangelista 2011; Garbin 2000; Isaat 2017; Mazzon 2014; Pellicano 2003; Pluchino 2010; Raimondo 2010; Shankar 2004; Tawfek 2019) .One study used ranking from 0 to 3 to measure pain experienced during the procedure, with 0 indicating no pain and 3 indicating severe pain not allowing completion of the procedure (Paschopoulos 2004).One study measured pain using another scale (present pain intensity (PPI) scale from 0 to 5), with 0 indicating no pain and 5 indicating excruciating pain, as well as a VAS (Shankar 2004) . Two studies reported procedures abandoned due to intense pain (Pellicano 2003; Tawfek 2019) .Two studies reported the need for analgesia (Isaat 2017; Pellicano 2003) . Seven studies reported adverse events and complications (Almeida 2008; Isaat 2017; Paschopoulos 2004; Pellicano 2003; Pluchino 2010; Raimondo 2010; Shankar 2004) .Studies did not report the total adverse events per woman randomised.As more than one of these adverse events could have occurred in one woman, we analysed each adverse event individually.These seven studies reported vasovagal reactions; four of them also reported shouldertip pain (Almeida 2008; Paschopoulos 2004; Pluchino 2010; Shankar 2004) , two reported bleeding from the endometrium (Almeida 2008; Pluchino 2010), and one reported infection (Isaat 2017). Quality of the hysteroscopic view was reported in seven trials (Almeida 2008; Diniz 2009; Garbin 2000; Mazzon 2014; Pellicano 2003; Raimondo 2010; Shankar 2004) .Two trials reported the quality of the hysteroscopic view on a scale; one trial used a 4-point scale (0 to 4) to rank the hysteroscopic view, with 0 indicating worst view and 4 indicating best view (Garbin 2000); the other trial used a 10-cm standardised VAS to measure the quality of the hysteroscopic view, with 0 indicating worst view and 10 indicating best view (Raimondo 2010).The other five trials reported the proportions of procedures with an unsatisfactory view (Almeida 2008; Diniz 2009; Mazzon 2014; Pellicano 2003; Shankar 2004) .Seven studies reported the duration of the procedure: four in minutes (Almeida 2008; Evangelista 2011; Pellicano 2003; Tawfek 2019) , and three in seconds (Isaat 2017; Mazzon 2014; Raimondo 2010) . We excluded eight studies from the review for the following reasons (Characteristics of excluded studies). 1. 4 of 8 were quasi-randomised trials (Brusco 2003; Kapur 2020; Litta 2003; Nagele 1996) . Nagele 1996; Salazar 2019).3. 1 of 8 had protocol breaks and was not published (Santos 2012). Assessment of risk of bias of included studies can be found in the Characteristics of included studies tables, as well as in Figure 2 and Figure 3 . Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. We rated nine trials at low risk of bias related to sequence generation. For studies comparing saline with carbon dioxide, the type of intervention could not be blinded from neither patients nor operators.As all outcomes were patient-or operator-reported, unmasking could influence the findings of outcomes, so we rated all studies in this comparison as having high risk of bias for these domains (Almeida 2008; Diniz 2009; Garbin 2000; Mazzon 2014; Paschopoulos 2004; Pellicano 2003; Pluchino 2010; Raimondo 2010; Shankar 2004) . Among the three studies comparing warm saline with room temperature saline, one study was patient-blinded (Evangelista 2011); we rated this study as having low risk of performance and detection bias, as primary outcomes were patient-reported and operators\\' knowing of the intervention is hardly likely to influence the results.The two other studies did not mention blinding of patients nor operators, and we rated them as having unclear risk of bias for these domains (Isaat 2017; Tawfek 2019). Eleven studies included all or most of the randomised women, and reasons for dropouts were explained and accounted for.We rated these studies as having low risk of attrition bias (Almeida 2008; Diniz 2009; Evangelista 2011; Garbin 2000; Isaat 2017; Mazzon 2014; Pellicano 2003; Pluchino 2010; Raimondo 2010; Shankar 2004; Tawfek 2019) .We assessed one study as having high risk of attrition bias because 5 of 79 women were excluded a er they were randomised and had received the intervention (Paschopoulos 2004); two exclusions were due to adverse events, and adverse events were unequally distributed between groups. We We rated one study as having unclear risk of bias in this domain, as its protocol was not available and study authors did not provide information on complications and adverse events (Diniz 2009). We rated two studies as having high risk of other bias due to unusually low standard deviations of means for pain during the procedure (Pellicano 2003; Pluchino 2010). See: Summary of findings 1 Saline vs carbon dioxide for uterine distension in outpatient hysteroscopy; Summary of findings 2 Warm saline vs room temperature saline for uterine distension in outpatient hysteroscopy See Summary of findings 1 and Summary of findings 2. 1. Tolerability of the procedure (Analysis 1.1; Analysis 1.2; Analysis 1.3; Figure 4 ) Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (1) Pain was reported as an ordinal outcome, so we converted it into a continuous outcome (2) Means and SDs were calculated by adding the data of two groups using the same distension media Analysis ruled out a clinically relevant di erence between both media in pain scores, but the quality of evidence was low (standardised mean di erence (SMD) -0.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.17 to 0.02; 9 randomised controlled trials (RCTs), N = 1705; I = 86%; Analysis 1.1; Figure 4 ).This translates to a di erence of 0.39 cm (lower) and 0.05 cm (higher) on a 10-cm visual analogue scale (VAS). Evidence was insu icient to show di erences between groups in the proportion of procedures abandoned due to intense pain (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.48, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.42; 1 RCT, N = 189; very lowquality evidence; Analysis 1.2): 2 of 97 (2%) in the saline group and 4 of 92 (4%) in the carbon dioxide group. We are uncertain whether saline lowers the need for analgesia when compared to carbon dioxide (Peto OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.99; 1 RCT, N = 189; very low-quality evidence; Analysis 1.3): 4 of 97 (4%) in the saline group and 11 of 92 (12%) in the carbon dioxide group. (Analysis 1.4) Saline is probably associated with fewer vasovagal reaction events than carbon dioxide when used as distension media for outpatient hysteroscopy (Peto OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.86; 6 RCTs, N = 1076; I = 0%; moderate-quality evidence).This suggests that if the chance for a vasovagal reaction with carbon dioxide is 10%, the chance with saline would be between 3% and 9%. Saline probably causes fewer shoulder-tip pain events than carbon dioxide when used as distension media for outpatient hysteroscopy (Peto OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.54; 4 RCTs, N = 623; I = 0%; moderatequality evidence).This suggests that if the chance for occurrence of shoulder-tip pain with carbon dioxide is 9%, the chance with saline would be between 1% and 5%. We are uncertain whether saline is similar to carbon dioxide in terms of endometrial bleeding events (Peto OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.25 to 2.75; 2 RCTs, N = 384; I = 0%): 5 of 174 events (3%) with saline and 6 of 175 events (3%) with carbon dioxide among participants. This outcome was not reported by any study in this comparison. (Analysis 1.5; Analysis 1.6; Analysis 1.7) Two RCTs measured this outcome, but each used a di erent scale (Results; Included studies).The two studies reported di erent directions of the treatment e ect; Garbin 2000 reported better clarity of the view with use of saline (3 ± 1.07) than with carbon dioxide (2.47 ± 1.24) on a 5-point scale (P = 0.003); Raimondo 2010 reported that carbon dioxide (8.9 ± 1.85) was better than saline (7 ± 0.7) on a 10-cm VAS (P < 0.001).Consequently, we did not pool the data in this analysis. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Saline may be associated with fewer procedures with an unsatisfactory hysteroscopic view than carbon dioxide (Peto OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.82; 5 RCTs, N = 1082; I = 67%; low-quality evidence; Analysis 1.6).This suggests that if the chance of an unsatisfactory hysteroscopic view with carbon dioxide is 9%, this chance would be between 3% and 8% with saline.Four studies reported duration of the procedure in this comparison; two studies reported the duration in minutes (Almeida 2008; Pellicano 2003) , and two other studies reported the duration in seconds (Mazzon 2014; Raimondo 2010).Due to marked heterogeneity in reported results (I = 95%), we did not pool the results in this analysis.The procedure was shorter with saline in three studies: Almeida 2008 (MD -55.80 seconds, 95% CI -99.15 to -12.45; N = 64), Mazzon 2014 (MD -26.50 seconds, 95% CI -33.17 to -19.83; N = 392), and Pellicano 2003 (MD -120.00 seconds, 95% CI -178.28 to -61.72; N = 189], and the duration was similar in both arms in the fourth study (Raimondo 2010) (MD -3.00 seconds, 95% CI -6.15 to 0.15; N = 264). None of the studies in this comparison reported any cost implications. No pre-specified subgroup analyses were conducted for this comparison. When analysis of primary outcomes was restricted to studies with low risk of selection bias, the rate of vasovagal reaction for both interventions (Analysis 1.4), but other primary outcomes did not substantially change (Analysis 1.1; Analysis 1.2; Analysis 1.3).Therefore, our conclusions for this comparison have not changed. When the random-e ects model was used for Analysis 1.1, the results did not substantially change.We could not use the randome ects model for analyses of other primary outcomes because these analyses were done by the Peto method. Use of the Mantel-Haenszel method to calculate risk ratios for dichotomous primary outcomes showed results similar to those obtained by the Peto method for primary analyses (Analysis 1.2; Analysis 1.3; Analysis 1.4). 1. Tolerability of the procedure 1.1.Pain during the procedure (Analysis 2.1; Analysis 2.2) Use of warm saline for uterine distension during o ice hysteroscopy may reduce pain scores when compared with room temperature saline (MD -1.14, 95% CI -1.57 to -0.73; 3 RCTs, N = 241; I = 77%; low-quality evidence; Analysis 2.1).However, this result should be interpreted with caution because the sensitivity analysis restricted to studies with low risk of selection bias failed to show a di erence between groups. Evidence was insu icient to show a di erence between groups in the proportion of procedures abandoned due to intense pain (Peto OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.06 to 15.87; 1 RCT, N = 77; very low-quality evidence; Analysis 2.2): 1 of 39 (3%) in the warm saline group and 1 of 38 (3%) in the room temperature saline group. Evidence was insu icient to show a di erence between groups in the need for analgesia (Peto OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.14 to 7.32; 1 RCT, N = 100; very low-quality evidence): 2 of 50 (4%) in the warm saline group and 2 of 50 (4%) in the room temperature saline group. Only one study reported this outcome (Isaat 2017).No cases of vasovagal reaction were observed in either group; therefore data were not pooled in this analysis. This outcome was not reported by any study for this comparison. This outcome was not reported by any study for this comparison. Only one study reported this outcome (Isaat 2017).No cases of infection were observed in either group; therefore data were not pooled in this analysis. This outcome was not reported by any study for this comparison. This outcome was not reported by any study for this comparison. (Analysis 2.4) Analysis ruled out a clinically relevant di erence in procedural duration between warm and room temperature saline, but the quality of evidence was low (MD 13.17 seconds, 95% CI -12.96 to 39.29; 2 RCTs, N = 141; I = 21%; Analysis 2.4). None of the studies for this comparison reported any cost implications. No pre-specified subgroup analyses were conducted for this comparison. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. When the analysis of primary outcomes was restricted to studies with low risk of selection bias, pain during the procedure di ered substantially and became similar in both interventions (Analysis 2.1).This sensitivity analysis could not be performed for other primary outcomes because the analyses included only one study (Analysis 2.2; Analysis 2.3). When the random-e ects model was used for Analysis 2.1, the results did not change substantially.We could not use the randome ects model for analyses of other primary outcomes because these analyses were done by the Peto method (Analysis 2.2; Analysis 2.3). Use of the Mantel-Haenszel method to calculate risk ratios for dichotomous primary outcomes showed results similar to those obtained by the Peto method for primary analyses (Analysis 2.2; Analysis 2.3). Heterogeneity was high in analyses for some outcomes (Analysis 1.1, I = 86%; Analysis 1.6, I = 67%; Analysis 1.7,I = 95%; Analysis 2.1, I = 77%).Pain during the procedure is a subjective outcome that is greatly influenced by many clinical variables (clinical heterogeneity) that varied across studies (e.g.age and parity of participants, operator experience, size of the hysteroscope, hysteroscopic approach, additional interventional techniques along with endometrial biopsy) (Analysis 1.1; Analysis 2.1), and data were insu icient for subgroup analyses to be performed. No explanation for the high heterogeneity was discovered in analyses of the quality of the hysteroscopic view (Analysis 1.6).The high heterogeneity in analysis of duration of the procedure may be related to the di erence in operator experience (clinical heterogeneity) (Analysis 1.7), but because of marked heterogeneity and non-overlap of confidence intervals, we did not perform the meta-analysis. We did not construct a funnel plot for any analysis because all analyses included fewer than 10 studies. We are uncertain whether saline and carbon dioxide are similarly tolerable among patients undergoing outpatient hysteroscopy because the quality of evidence is very low to low.However, carbon dioxide probably causes more adverse events (vasovagal reaction and shoulder-tip pain) than saline (moderate-quality evidence). Saline may provide a better hysteroscopic view than carbon dioxide (low-quality evidence).Evidence on duration of the procedure is insu icient.No studies have reported any cost implications. Pain scores during the procedure using warm saline might be lower than those when room temperature saline is used (low-quality evidence).However, studies with low risk of selection bias failed to show a di erence in pain scores between the two interventions.Therefore, extreme caution should be taken when results for this outcome are interpreted.We are uncertain of the e ects of warm saline on the proportion of procedures abandoned due to intense pain and on the need for analgesia because the quality of evidence is very low.Infection, the only adverse event reported for this comparison, did not occur with either medium. Procedural duration may be similar with warm and room temperature saline (low-quality evidence).No studies for this comparison reported on quality of the hysteroscopic view nor on cost implications. Outpatient hysteroscopy is a widely used tool that allows diagnosis and a few therapeutic interventions.It provides the benefit of visualisation of intrauterine lesions.Moreover, it is done in an outpatient setting without general anaesthesia.As a result, the patient is aware of what is happening, and this makes it more di icult for both the patient and the operator to perform than other procedures done under general anaesthesia.Searching for the best uterine distension medium that is most tolerable, has the fewest side e ects, and at the same time gives the best hysteroscopic view is challenging. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the uterine distension media identified in this review are few.Most of these trials have investigated saline versus carbon dioxide.Studies included participants with di erent characteristics (nullipara and multipara, reproductive age and menopausal women) undergoing hysteroscopy for any indication (infertility or abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB)) without analgesia or anaesthesia in an outpatient setting.This variation gives results the advantage of generalisability, along with clinical heterogeneity, as most outcomes are dependent on these factors.Hysteroscopes used across studies varied in the diameter of their outer sheaths.These di erences, as well as variation in operator experience, can a ect patient tolerability (Pluchino 2010).The approach of the introduction of the hysteroscope into the vagina and the cervix also varied across studies.Some studies used di erent approaches in di erent study groups.In other studies, patients underwent surgical procedures or endometrial biopsies in the same setting when necessary.All these clinical di erences might have given rise to di erent treatment e ects and could have accounted for the high statistical heterogeneity noted in subjective outcomes.None of the studies reported cost implications of both media, which might be important in considering the best medium, especially if other outcomes show similar results. We used the GRADE approach to assess the overall evidence in this review, which ranged from very low to moderate quality (see Figure 2 ; Summary of findings 1; Summary of findings 2).We downgraded the quality of evidence mainly due to risk of bias, imprecision, and inconsistency. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. The major limitation of this review is the small number of identified studies, preventing us from giving robust conclusions.Another limitation is the high risk of performance and selection biases because the main outcomes are subjective and are patient-or operator-reported, and blinding to the allocated intervention was not possible, especially when the media studied were gas versus liquid.Therefore, this might have influenced the results of individual studies. We ran a thorough search of databases using comprehensive strategies with the help of the Information Specialist in the CGF Group, to ensure inclusion of all eligible studies.We handsearched references of included studies as well as similar systematic reviews on the same intervention.We could not construct funnel plots to detect publication bias because each comparison included fewer than 10 studies. We tried to contact all authors of included and excluded studies, as well as authors of trial registrations, to confirm eligibility, but most authors did not respond to our emails. We identified two previous systematic reviews that compared only saline to carbon dioxide (Cooper 2011; Craciunas 2013).We intended to include any RCT comparing any two or more distension media, to make the review more comprehensive and to draw conclusions on the best distension medium in outpatient hysteroscopy. This review found insu icient evidence that saline might be associated with the same pain scores as carbon dioxide, in keeping with the results of Cooper 2011, but not with the findings of Craciunas 2013, which concluded that pain scores were lower with the use of saline.Both reviews, however, included quasi-randomised trials that were excluded from this review to prevent selection bias.Nevertheless, the results of this review are consistent with those of both reviews that saline is associated with fewer side e ects (shoulder-tip pain and vasovagal reaction). Evidence is insu icient to conclude that there are di erences between di erent distension media used for uterine distension in outpatient hysteroscopy in terms of patient tolerability, operator satisfaction, and duration of the procedure.However, saline was superior to carbon dioxide in producing fewer adverse events (shoulder-tip pain and vasovagal reaction). More high-quality well-designed RCTs comparing gaseous and liquid distension media or liquid media at di erent temperatures are needed.These studies should standardise -or include in a powered subgroup analysis -the patient\\'s menopausal state (reproductive age versus post menopause), parity (nullipara versus multipara), indication of hysteroscopy, size of the hysteroscope, hysteroscopic approach, and operator experience, with avoidance of any surgical manoeuvres in the same setting.Also, future studies should consider performing cost-e ectiveness analyses in comparing di erent media.

Random sequence generation (selection bias) Low risk Quote: \"randomization was performed by a statistical consultant using computer-generated numbers\" Low risk Quote: \"the distension medium was assigned before starting the diagnostic procedure by opening a sealed, opaque envelope containing the group allotment\" Blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias) All outcomes Although study authors mentioned, \"Patients were not allowed to follow the procedure on a monitor\", blinding was not possible in this type of intervention for neither patients nor operators, which might induce performance bias Blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias) All outcomes Blinding was not possible in this type of intervention, and as outcomes were either patient-assessed or operator-assessed, we judged risk of detection bias as high Low risk Although there were randomised participants who were excluded from analysis due to the need for endometrial biopsy, this was unlikely to cause bias, as the number of excluded participants was nearly similar in both groups (10 in carbon dioxide group vs 12 in saline group) Selective reporting (reporting bias) Low risk All outcomes mentioned in the protocol were reported in the publication Financial support from the hysteroscopy manufacturer received by one study author was unlikely to have had an influence, as the same hysteroscope was used in both groups Random sequence generation (selection bias) Low risk Quote: \"all women were asked to choose between two identical, sealed envelopes.One of the envelopes contained the indication 1, which corresponded to CO 2 , and the other the indication 2, which corresponded to normal saline\" Comment: this was based on chance process, and there was a 50% chance for every patient on either indication In one group, hysteroscopy will be performed in the clinic using room temperature saline to distend the uterine cavity (the existing method in use) In the second group, saline warmed to body temperature will be used Outcomes Discomfort levels are assessed in the 2 groups using pain scores Notes A full text was not found, and the abstract could not be retrieved No email could be found to contact the study author (1) Pain was reported as an ordinal outcome, so we converted it into a continuous outcome (2) Means and SDs were calculated by adding the data of two groups using the same distension media -55.80 [-99.15 , -12.45] -26.50 [-33.17 , -19 .83] -120.00 [-178.28 , -61.

To evaluate the benefits and harms of cervical pessary for preventing preterm birth in women with singleton pregnancies and risk factors for cervical insu iciency compared to no treatment, vaginal progesterone, cervical cerclage or bedrest. We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth\\'s Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.govand the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform to 22 September 2021.We also searched the reference lists of included studies for additional records. We included published and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing cervical pessary with no treatment, vaginal progesterone, cervical cerclage or bedrest for preventing PTB.We excluded quasi-randomised trials.Our primary outcome was delivery before 34 weeks\\' gestation.Our secondary outcomes were 1. delivery before 37 weeks\\' gestation, 2. maternal mortality, 3. maternal infection or inflammation, 4. preterm prelabour rupture of membranes, 5. harm to woman from the intervention, 6. maternal medications, 7. discontinuation of the intervention, 8. maternal satisfaction, 9. neonatal/paediatric care unit admission, 10. fetal/infant mortality, 11. neonatal sepsis, 12. gestational age at birth, 13. harm to o spring from the intervention 14. birthweight, 15. early neurodevelopmental morbidity, 15. late neurodevelopmental morbidity, 16. gastrointestinal morbidity and 17. respiratory morbidity. Two review authors independently assessed trials for eligibility and risk of bias, evaluated trustworthiness based on criteria developed by the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Review Group, extracted data, checked for accuracy and assessed certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. We included eight RCTs (2983 participants).We included five RCTs (1830 women) in the comparison cervical pessary versus no treatment, three RCTs (1126 pregnant women) in the comparison cervical pessary versus vaginal progesterone, and one study (13 participants) in the comparison cervical pessary versus cervical cerclage.Overall, the certainty of evidence was low to moderate due to inconsistency Cochrane Library Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. We searched for studies that examined cervical pessary compared with any other treatment, or no treatment, in women with singleton pregnancy who were at risk of having cervical weakness.We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. We found eight randomised studies (where participants were randomly assigned to their treatment group) involving 2983 pregnant women.We were able to extract data for three comparisons: cervical pessary versus no treatment, cervical pessary versus progesterone, and cervical pessary versus cervical cerclage.The studies took place in 15 high-income countries. In women with singleton pregnancy, the use of cervical pessary may decrease the risk of preterm birth compared to no treatment or vaginal progesterone, although the evidence around this was not robust.It is unclear if cervical pessary has an e ect on maternal infection or other outcomes related to the baby for all comparisons. We have little confidence in the evidence because the results varied widely between studies and there were not enough studies.Future studies are needed to confirm the beneficial e ect of cervical pessary on preterm birth.They should include lower-income settings so that the findings can be applied to a wider population. Risk with no treatment (singleton pregnancy) Not reported Not reported - Not reported Not reported -*The risk in the intervention group (and its 95% confidence interval) is based on the assumed risk in the comparison group and the relative effect of the intervention (and its 95% CI).CI: confidence interval; RCT: randomised controlled trial; RR: risk ratio. High certainty: we are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect. Moderate certainty: we are moderately confident in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different. Low certainty: our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.Very low certainty: we have very little confidence in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect. a Downgraded one level for serious inconsistency (substantial unexplained statistical heterogeneity) and one level for serious imprecision (wide 95% CI consistent with possible benefit and possible harm).b Downgraded one level for serious risk of bias due to lack of blinding.c Downgraded two levels for very serious imprecision (few events and wide 95% CI consistent with possible benefit and possible harm).d Downgraded one level for serious inconsistency (substantial unexplained statistical heterogeneity) and one level for serious imprecision (few events).Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews An earlier Cochrane Review on cervical pessary for preventing preterm birth (PTB) included both singleton and multiple pregnancy (Abdel-Aleem 2013).That review was split into two new reviews to cover the populations in separate analyses (women with singleton pregnancy (this review) and women with multiple pregnancy). PTB, defined as birth before 37 weeks of gestation, occurs in around 10% of all births (Institute of Medicine 2011), and is one of the leading causes of infant mortality (70%; Blencowe 2012; Bolbocean 2022 ; Ngoc 2006 ; O ice of National Statistics 2012).Indeed, perinatal morbidity and mortality are inversely related to gestational age at delivery (D\\'Onofrio 2013; Saigal 2008) .Premature neonates represent a large economic burden (Liu 2012) . Cervical insu iciency is a common cause of PTB, but it is di icult to diagnose, owing to the multifactorial aetiology of second trimester miscarriage and spontaneous PTB.Diagnosis is o en based on medical history, clinical examination or ultrasound examination during pregnancy.Typical risk factors include having two or more second-trimester pregnancy losses, having prelabour rupture of membranes before 32 weeks\\' gestation, a history of cervical trauma caused by cone biopsy, forced dilation or intrapartum cervical lacerations or congenital uterine anomalies (Lo 2009; Wie 2021) . Other possible risk factors are clinical findings during pregnancy of short cervix, dilated cervix, protruding membranes or cervical tear; and ultrasound findings of short cervical length, defined as less than 25 mm at 20 weeks\\' gestation (Owen 2004; Wie 2021) , or funnelling of the cervix during the second or early third trimester of pregnancy (Ayers 1988) . Cervical cerclage is one strategy aimed at preventing premature opening of the cervix (Anthony 1997; Gibb 1995; McDonald 1957; Shirodkar 1955) .All operations carry risks, and cervical cerclage is an invasive technique that requires anaesthesia and is associated with complications including haemorrhage, infection and miscarriage (McDonald 1957; Shirodkar 1955) .One Cochrane Review (15 trials, 3490 women) concluded that cervical cerclage reduces the risk of PTB in high-risk women and probably reduces the risk of perinatal death.Whether cerclage is more or less e ective than other preventive treatments remains unclear (Alfirevic 2017). Administration of progesterone has been also advocated for preventing PTB in singleton pregnancy (Jarde 2019) One Cochrane Review on this topic included 36 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with 8523 women and 12,515 infants, and found that in women with a history of spontaneous PTB, progesterone reduces the risk of perinatal mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.33 to 0.75) and delivery before 34 weeks (average RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.69) compared to placebo (Dodd 2013) . The strategy of using cervical pessaries for managing cervical insu iciency was introduced in the 1950s (Arabin 2003); however, support for this approach has been inconsistent over the subsequent decades (Acharya 2006; Antczak-Judycka 2003; Arabin 2003; Quaas 1990) . The cervical pessary is a specially made silicone device that is inserted into the upper vagina to support the cervix and prevent PTB (Goya 2012; Hui 2012; Nicolaides 2016; Saccone 2017) .Most studies investigating this device have used the Arabin pessary, which is a flexible, ring-like pessary available in di erent sizes (outer diameter 65 mm or 70 mm, inner diameter 32 mm or 35 mm, height of the curvature 21 mm or 25 mm).A clinician examines the cervix using a speculum to determine the appropriate pessary dimensions.The pessary is inserted with its curvature upwards so that the larger diameter is supported by the pelvic floor.The smaller inner diameter should encompass the cervix.A er inserting the pessary, the clinician should ensure the pregnant woman has no uterine activity, discomfort or vaginal bleeding (Arabin 2003; Saccone 2017). The mechanism by which the pessary can prevent cervical insu iciency (also called incompetent cervix) is not exactly known. In 1961, Vitsky suggested that the incompetent cervix is aligned centrally, with no support except the non-resistant vagina (Vitsky 1961) .A lever pessary, however, would change the inclination of the cervical canal, directing it posteriorly.Thus, the weight of the pregnancy would be more on the anterior lower segment (Arabin 2003) .Another postulated mechanism is that the pessary supports the immunological barrier between the chorioamnion-extraovular space and the vaginal microbiological flora; cerclage may work in the same way (Goya 2012; Nicolaides 2016; Saccone 2017). Cervical pessary is a minimally invasive intervention for preventing PTB.Non-randomised trials have shown that treating women with a short cervix with cervical pessary prolonged the pregnancy compared to expectant management.In such trial, mean gestational age at delivery was 38 weeks (range 36 weeks 6 days to 41 weeks) in the pessary group and 33 weeks (range 26 weeks 4 days to 38 weeks) in the control group, with a P value of 0.02 between the groups (Arabin 2003). Cervical pessary insertion is an outpatient procedure that does not require anaesthesia, surgery or medications.In one multicentre RCT conducted in Spain, the only reported side e ects of this intervention were increased vaginal discharge and expulsion of the pessary (Goya 2012).In this and other studies, there were no serious infectious complications reported during or a er removal of the pessary (Goya 2012; Quaas 1990; Jin 2017) . Previous Cochrane Reviews of cervical pessaries included studies on singleton and multiple pregnancies (Abdel-Aleem 2010; Abdel-Aleem 2013).The results of meta-analysis conducted by Jin and colleagues in 2017 showed that the available evidence did not support the use of cervical pessary in singleton pregnancy with short cervix, and they recommended more RCTs on this topic (Jin 2017) . In To evaluate the benefits and harms of cervical pessary for preventing preterm birth in women with singleton pregnancies and risk factors for cervical insu iciency compared to no treatment, vaginal progesterone, cervical cerclage or bedrest. We considered only RCTs, including cluster-RCTs but excluding quasi-RCTs.We included studies published as abstracts if they contained enough information to assess eligibility and if they met the criteria for scientific integrity. Pregnant women with singleton viable fetus before 34 weeks\\' gestation with risk factors for PTB due to cervical insu iciency. Relevant risk factors included: • history of second-trimester abortion or preterm labour (excluding those resulting from induced preterm labour or placental abruption); • history of prelabour rupture of membranes before 32 weeks\\' gestation; • short cervical length (25 mm or less at 18 to 24 weeks of gestation), determined by transvaginal ultrasound examination; • history of cervical trauma caused by cone biopsy, forced dilation or intrapartum cervical lacerations; and • congenital uterine anomalies. • Cervical cerclage in current pregnancy We planned the following comparisons: • cervical pessary versus no treatment; • cervical pessary versus vaginal progesterone; • cervical pessary versus cervical cerclage; and • cervical pessary versus bed rest (at hospital or at home as reported by study authors). The outcomes below are adapted from a core outcome set (van \\'t Hoo 2016). • Delivery before 34 weeks\\' gestation (including spontaneous and induced labour) • Delivery before 37 weeks\\' gestation (including spontaneous and induced labour) The following methods section of this review is based on a standard template used by Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth.Two people screened the search results and review the full-text articles of all relevant trial reports.Based on the intervention described, each trial report is assigned a number that corresponds to a specific Pregnancy and Childbirth review topic (or topics), and is then added to the Register.The Information Specialist searches the Register for each review using this topic number rather than keywords.This results in a more specific search set that has been fully accounted for in the relevant review sections (Included studies; Excluded studies; Studies awaiting classification; Ongoing studies). In addition, we searched ClinicalTrials.govand the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) for unpublished, planned and ongoing trial reports (22 September 2021) using the search methods detailed in Appendix 1. We searched the reference lists of retrieved studies. We applied no language or date restrictions. Two review authors independently assessed all potential studies identified by the Information Specialist.In case of discrepancies, they consulted a third review author. We created a study flow diagram to map the number of records identified, included and excluded. Two review authors independently evaluated all studies meeting our inclusion criteria to select those that, based on available information, were su iciently trustworthy to include in the analysis.To do this, the review authors answered the following questions. Research governance • Is the study free from participant characteristics that appear too similar (e.g.distribution of the mean and standard deviation (SD) excessively narrow or excessively wide, as noted by Carlisle 2017). • Is the study free from characteristics that could be implausible (e.g.large numbers of women with a rare condition such as severe cholestasis recruited within 12 months)?In cases with (close to) zero losses to follow-up, is there a plausible explanation? • Is the study free from implausible results (e.g.massive risk reduction for main outcomes with small sample size)?• Do the numbers randomised to each group suggest that the study authors used adequate randomisation methods?For example, is the study free from issues such as unexpectedly even numbers of women randomised or a mismatch between the numbers and methods? We attempted to contact the authors of studies considered untrustworthy to address any concerns or request missing information.If we could not obtain contact details for the study authors, or if adequate information remained unavailable, we did not include the study but recorded all relevant details in the Characteristics of studies awaiting classification table, describing in detail the reasons and communications with the study author (or lack thereof). We included data from abstracts only if the study authors confirmed in writing that the data to be included in the review came from the final analysis and would not change.If such information were unavailable, we did not include the study but recorded all relevant details in the Characteristics of studies awaiting classification table. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Review authors extracted data from the included studies using a data extraction form adapted from\\'Good practice templates\\' developed by the Cochrane Editorial Resources Committee (including trial dates, sources of trial funding and trial authors\\' declarations of interest).We resolved disagreement through discussion.We entered data into Review Manager 5 so ware (RevMan 5) and checked for accuracy (RevMan 2014).We followed Cochrane Methodological Expectations of Cochrane Intervention Reviews (MECIR) Standards (Higgins 2022) . Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011) .We resolved any disagreement by discussion or by involving a third review author. We described for each included study the method used to generate the allocation sequence in su icient detail to assess whether it should produce comparable groups.We judged the methods at low risk of bias (any truly random process, e.g.random number table, computer random number generator), high risk of bias (any nonrandom process, e.g.odd or even date of birth, hospital or clinic record number) or unclear risk of bias. We described for each included study the method used to conceal allocation to interventions prior to assignment and also assessed whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen before or during recruitment, or changed a er assignment.We judged the methods at low risk of bias (e.g.telephone or central randomisation, consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes), high risk of bias (e.g.open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation, date of birth) or unclear risk of bias. We described for each included study, and for each outcome or class of outcome, the methods used, if any, to blind study participants and personnel to the treatment allocation.We judged studies at low risk of bias if they were blinded, or if we considered the lack of blinding would be unlikely to a ect results.We judged the methods at low, high or unclear risk of bias for participants; and low, high or unclear risk of bias for personnel. We described for each included study, and for each outcome or class of outcome, the methods used, if any, to blind outcome assessors to the treatment allocation.We judged the methods at low, high or unclear risk of bias. We described for each included study, and for each outcome or class of outcomes, the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis.We stated whether study authors had reported attrition and exclusions, the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes.Where trial reports or trial authors provided su icient information relating to participants with missing data, we included the data that had been reported for those participants in our analyses.We judged the methods at low risk of bias (e.g.no missing outcome data, missing outcome data balanced across groups), high risk of bias (e.g.numbers or reasons for missing data imbalanced across groups, as-treated analysis with substantial departure from assigned interventions) or unclear risk of bias. We described for each included study how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We judged the methods at low risk of bias (where it was clear that all the study\\'s prespecified outcomes were reported), high risk of bias (where not all the study\\'s prespecified outcomes were reported, outcomes of interest were reported incompletely and so could not be used, or the study failed to include results of a key expected outcome) or unclear risk of bias. We described for each included study any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias, judging each study at low, high or unclear risk of other bias. We made explicit judgements about whether studies were at high risk of bias, according to the criteria set out in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011) . We assessed the likely magnitude and direction of types of bias described above and whether they were likely to have a ected the findings.We also explored the impact of the level of bias through sensitivity analyses (see Sensitivity analysis). For dichotomous data, we presented results as summary risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).For continuous data, we used mean di erences (MDs) if outcomes were measured in the same way between trials, or standardised mean di erences (SMDs) to combine trials that measured the same outcome with di erent methods. We identified no eligible cluster-randomised trials.If we identify any such trials in updates of this review, we will include them in our analyses along with individually randomised trials.We will use intracluster correlation coe icients (ICCs) from other sources and document our decisions.We will also consider it reasonable to combine the results from both cluster-and individually randomised trials if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs and we consider the choice of randomisation unit is unlikely to have a ected the results of the intervention. We will acknowledge heterogeneity in the randomisation unit and perform a sensitivity analysis to investigate the e ects of the randomisation unit. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. For included studies, we noted the levels of attrition.We had planned to explore the impact of including studies with high levels of missing data in the overall assessment of treatment e ect through a sensitivity analysis. For all outcomes, we carried out intention-to-treat analyses wherever possible.This means we attempted to include all randomised participants in the analyses, in the group to which they were allocated, regardless of whether they received the allocated intervention.The denominator for each outcome in each trial was the number randomised minus any participants with missing data. We excluded from the analysis trials with high risk of bias (high levels of missing data or a large number of participants analysed in the wrong group). We assessed statistical heterogeneity in each meta-analysis using the Tau 2 , I 2 and Chi 2 statistics.We regarded heterogeneity as substantial if the I 2 value was greater than 30% and either the Tau 2 value was greater than zero or the Chi 2 test P value was below 0.10. In updates of this review, if we include 10 or more studies in the meta-analysis, we will investigate reporting biases (such as publication bias) using funnel plots.We will assess funnel plot asymmetry visually.If this visual assessment suggests asymmetry, we will perform exploratory analyses. We carried out statistical analysis using RevMan 5 (RevMan 2014).We used fixed-e ect meta-analysis to combine data where it was reasonable to assume that studies estimated the same underlying treatment e ect (i.e.where trials examined the same intervention, and the populations and methods were judged su iciently similar).We used random-e ects meta-analysis if we found su icient clinical heterogeneity to suggest di ering underlying treatment e ects between trials, or substantial statistical heterogeneity.We treated the random-e ects summary as the average of the range of possible treatment e ects, and we discussed the clinical implications of treatment e ects di ering between trials.If the average treatment e ect was not clinically meaningful, we did not combine trials. If we used random-e ects analyses, we presented the results as the average treatment e ect with 95% CIs, and the estimates of Tau 2 and I 2 . Where we identified substantial heterogeneity, we investigated it through subgroup analyses.We considered whether an overall summary was meaningful, and if it was, we used random-e ects analysis to produce it. We divided studies into subgroups by type of cervical pessary (Arabian pessary versus other pessaries).We had planned to add a subgroup for unspecified types of pessary. We used the primary outcome of the review in the subgroup analysis (delivery before 34 weeks\\' gestation). We assessed subgroup di erences using interaction tests available within RevMan 5 (RevMan 2014), and we reported the results of subgroup analyses quoting the Chi 2 statistic and P value, and the interaction test I value. We had planned to carry out sensitivity analyses for aspects of the review that might a ect the results, for example, where there was risk of bias associated with the quality of some included trials.We may also have considered sensitivity analysis to explore the impact of fixed-or random-e ects analyses for outcomes with statistical heterogeneity and the impact of any assumptions made, such as ICC value used for cluster-randomised trials.We performed a sensitivity analysis for the primary outcome where we removed trials in which participants received progesterone as a cointervention, as progesterone could a ect outcomes. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach for the following key outcomes: • delivery before 34 weeks\\' gestation; • delivery before 37 weeks\\' gestation; • maternal infection or inflammation (genital or urinary tract infection requiring treatment at any time a er randomisation); • neonatal/paediatric care unit admission (for any reason); • fetal/infant mortality; • harm to o spring from the intervention (e.g.evidence of congenital fetal or neonatal infection, evidence of direct mechanical pressure from the device); and • birthweight. We assessed these seven key outcomes for each of the following comparisons: • cervical pessary versus no treatment; • cervical pessary versus vaginal progesterone treatment; and • cervical pessary versus cervical cerclage. We used GRADEpro GDT to import data from Review Manager 5 (RevMan 2014) and create summary of findings tables.Using the GRADE approach, we produced a summary of the intervention e ect and a measure of certainty for each key outcome.The GRADE approach includes five considerations (study limitations, consistency of e ect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the certainty of the body of evidence for each outcome.Evidence from RCTs can be downgraded from \\'high certainty\\' by one level for serious limitations (or by two levels for very serious limitations) related to any of these five considerations.For presenting and reporting of the results within the context of GRADE assessment, we referred to Table 1 of the GRADE guidelines 26 (Santesso 2020). The search retrieved 78 records, of which four were duplicates.A er eliminating five records in the title and abstract screen, we Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews assessed 39 studies (69 reports) for eligibility.We excluded 14 studies and identified sixteen ongoing studies at this stage.Two review authors evaluated the remaining nine studies that met the inclusion criteria against Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth\\'s set of predefined criteria to identify studies that, based on available information, were su iciently trustworthy to be included in the analysis (the criteria include questions related to research governance, baseline characteristics, feasibility and results).One trial (Karbasian 2016) was not registered prospectively, and the protocol was not published.We attempted to contact the study authors (via Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth) with our queries but received no response.Karbasian 2016 will remain awaiting classification until we update this review.We included eight studies (24 reports), involving 2983 pregnant women (Care 2021; Cruz-Melguizo 2018; Dugo 2018; Goya 2012; Hui 2013; Nicolaides 2016; Pacagnella 2022; Saccone 2017) .Figure 1 (Hui 2013) . All studies only included women with cervical length of 25 mm or less.Gestational age at recruitment varied between studies (16 weeks 0 days to 24 weeks 6 days in Care 2021, 18 weeks to 23 weeks in Dugo 2018 and Pacagnella 2022, 19 weeks to 22 weeks in Cruz-Melguizo 2018 and Goya 2012, 20 weeks to 24 weeks in Hui 2013 and Nicolaides 2016, and 18 weeks 0 days to 23 weeks 6 days in Saccone 2017).All studies included women with singleton pregnancies except Pacagnella 2022, which included both singleton and twin pregnancies (we only included data from the singleton pregnancy subgroup in our analysis). We included five trials in the comparison cervical pessary versus no treatment (Dugo 2018; Goya 2012; Hui 2013 ; Nicolaides 2016; Saccone 2017).In three of these trials, women in both groups with cervical length less than 15 mm received additional vaginal progesterone until 36 weeks and 6 days of gestation (Dugo 2018; Nicolaides 2016; Saccone 2017).We included three trials in the comparison cervical pessary versus vaginal progesterone (Cruz-Melguizo 2018; Care 2021; Pacagnella 2022).Finally, we included one study in the comparison cervical pessary versus cervical cerclage (Care 2021).No studies compared cervical pessary to bed rest. Only two of our 19 outcomes of interest were reported in all included studies (delivery before 34 weeks and delivery before 37 weeks).No study reported more than 10 of our review outcomes. Public sources funded three studies (Care 2021; Cruz-Melguizo 2018; Goya 2012), and not-for-profit organisations funded another three (Dugo 2018; Nicolaides 2016; Pacagnella 2022) .Two studies provided no information about their sources of funding (Hui 2013; Saccone 2017) . Two studies made no mention of potential conflicts of interest (Dugo 2018; Hui 2013) . The remaining six studies reported that no authors had any conflicts of interest to declare (Care 2021; Cruz-Melguizo 2018; Goya 2012; Nicolaides 2016; Pacagnella 2022; Saccone 2017). We identified 16 ongoing RCTs, with two or three arms.Ten studies are investigating cervical pessary compared with progesterone (Hezelgrave 2016; IRCT201603109568N15; NCT02470676; NCT02511574; NCT02901626; NCT03052270; NCT03227705; NCT03637062; NCT04300322; van Zijl 2017); four studies are investigating cervical pessary compared with no treatment (IRCT20180302038914N1; JPRN-UMIN000015465; NCT03418012; NCT04147117); three studies are investigating cervical pessary compared with cervical cerclage (IRCT20180302038914N1; Koullali 2017; NCT02405455); and one study is investigating vaginal progesterone plus cervical pessary versus vaginal progesterone alone (NCT03052270). Karbasian 2016 is awaiting classification pending information from the study authors and subsequent screening by the review authors. We excluded 14 studies from this review.Five had an inappropriate design: non-RCT (Barinov 2017; Mendoza 2017; Ples 2021), quasi-RCT (Von Forster 1986) , or simulation study (Willan 2016).One study was not registered prospectively and reported only the results of an interim analysis (Daskalakis 2013).We contacted the study authors but received no response.In eight studies, the participants did not meet out eligibility criteria: four included women with placenta praevia (Barinov 2020; Gmoser 1991; Hermans 2016; Sta ord 2019) , and four included women with threatened PTB (NCT02484820 2015; Mastantuoni 2021; Naeiji 2021; Pratcorona 2019). We judged all studies at low risk of bias for random sequence generation and allocation concealment. We considered seven studies at high risk of performance bias (Care 2021; Cruz-Melguizo 2018; Dugo 2018; Goya 2012; Nicolaides 2016; Pacagnella 2022; Saccone 2017) because blinding of participants and personnel was not possible.We judged Hui 2013 at unclear risk of performance bias because all participants had a digital vaginal examination (in an attempt to simulate insertion of a pessary in the control group), but it is unclear whether personnel were blinded. We considered six studies at high risk of detection bias (Care 2021; Cruz-Melguizo 2018; Dugo 2018; Goya 2012; Nicolaides 2016; Pacagnella 2022).We judged Hui 2013 at unclear risk of detection bias because the trial report stated that data were obtained from hospital records.We judged Saccone 2017 at low risk of detection bias because the outcome assessors and personnel involved in data collection and analysis were blinded. We considered all studies at low risk of attrition bias because loss to follow-up ranged from 0% to 5%. Because all studies adhered to their preregistered protocols, we considered them at low risk of reporting bias (Figure 2 ). We Five studies provided data for this comparison (Dugo 2018; Goya 2012; Hui 2013; Nicolaides 2016; Saccone 2017). Five studies measured delivery before 34 weeks\\' gestation (Dugo 2018; Goya 2012; Hui 2013 ; Nicolaides 2016; Saccone 2017).Cervical pessary compared with no treatment may reduce the risk of delivery before 34 weeks (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.55; 5 studies, 1830 women; low-certainty evidence; Analysis 1.1).However, we are very uncertain about the results because the upper limit of the 95% CI indicates substantial harm (i.e. an increase in PTB before 34 weeks\\' gestation with cervical pessary).Due to substantial heterogeneity between studies, we used the random-e ects model for this meta-analysis (Tau 2 = 0.65, I 2 = 90%). We divided the studies into two subgroups according to type of pessary: Arabin (Goya 2012; Hui 2013; Nicolaides 2016; Saccone 2017) and Bioteque (Dugo 2018).The test for subgroup di erences did not suggest a di erence in e ect between Arabin and Bioteque (Chi 2 = 1.07,P = 0.30, I 2 = 6.2%), although the number of studies was insu icient for valid subgroup analysis.Three studies used progesterone as a cointervention (Dugo 2018; Nicolaides 2016; Saccone 2017).The sensitivity analysis that excluded these studies did not change the point estimate substantially but made the 95% CI considerably wider (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.09 to 3.84). Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Delivery before 37 weeks\\' gestation Five studies measured delivery before 37 weeks\\' gestation (Dugo 2018; Goya 2012; Hui 2013; Nicolaides 2016; Saccone 2017) .Cervical pessary compared with no treatment may reduce the risk of delivery before 37 weeks compared with no treatment (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.05; 5 studies, 1830 women; low-certainty evidence; Analysis 1.2; Summary of findings 1).However, the 95% CI crosses the line of no e ect, so we cannot rule out a slight increase in PTB.We used the random-e ects model for this analysis because of substantial heterogeneity between studies (Tau 2 = 0.19, I 2 = 83%). No studies reported maternal mortality. Two studies reported vaginal infection (Hui 2013 ; Nicolaides 2016). Cervical pessary probably results in little or no di erence in the risk of vaginal infection compared with no treatment (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.26; 2 studies, 1032 women; moderate-certainty evidence; Analysis 1.3; Summary of findings 1). We identified two additional outcomes that were not included in the definition of maternal infection and inflammation but that were of clinical importance: vaginal discharge and chorioamnionitis. Four studies showed increased vaginal discharge in the pessary arm (Dugo 2018; Goya 2012; Nicolaides 2016; Saccone 2017), and three studies showed no significant di erence between cervical pessary and no treatment in risk of chorioamnionitis (Dugo 2018; Goya 2012; Saccone 2017). Four studies reported preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (Dugo 2018; Goya 2012; Nicolaides 2016; Saccone 2017).It is unclear if cervical pessary compared to no treatment decreases the risk of preterm prelabour rupture of membranes because the 95% CIs are compatible with a wide range of e ects that encompass both appreciable benefit and harm (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.65; 4 studies, 906 women; Analysis 1.4).Because of substantial heterogeneity, we used the random-e ects model (Tau 2 = 0.52, I 2 = 66%). Goya 2012 reported pregnancy bleeding in 7/190 (3.6%) women in the cervical pessary group and 9/190 (4.7%) in the no treatment group, with no clear di erence between the groups (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.30 to 2.05; 380 women; Analysis 1.5). Data from Hui 2013 and Nicolaides 2016 suggested an increase in the risk of pelvic discomfort in the pessary group (RR 3.15, 95% CI 1.88 to 5.29; I 2 = 0%; 2 studies, 1033 women; Analysis 1.5). This outcome included three types of medications; tocolytic treatment (reported by Goya 2012), corticosteroid treatment for fetal maturation (reported by Goya 2012; Hui 2013) and antibiotics following positive swabs (reported by Nicolaides 2016). Compared to no treatment, cervical pessary may reduce the need for tocolytic treatment (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.81; 1 study, 380 women; Analysis 1.6), and corticosteroid treatment (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.84; 2 studies, 488 women; Analysis 1.6), but may increase antibiotic use (RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.02; 1 study, 924 women; Analysis 1.6). We did not analyse the data for discontinuation of the intervention because it applied to only the cervical pessary arms of the studies.Three of the five studies reported varying rates of discontinuation of pessary use: half of participants (51.7%) in Dugo 2018, one quarter (24.7%) in Nicolaides 2016, and only 1/192 in Goya 2012.Reported causes of discontinuation were preterm labour, prelabour rupture of membranes, iatrogenic delivery and participant request. Only Goya 2012 reported maternal satisfaction, stating that all pessary users would recommend the intervention to other people. Neonatal/paediatric care unit admission Three studies reported neonatal/paediatric care unit admission (Hui 2013; Nicolaides 2016; Saccone 2017) .It is unclear if cervical pessary compared with no treatment has an e ect on the risk of neonatal/paediatric care unit admission because the 95% CI is compatible with a wide range of e ects that encompass both appreciable benefit and harm (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.59; 3 studies, 1332 infants; low-certainty evidence; Analysis 1.7; Summary of findings 1).Because of substantial heterogeneity, we used the random-e ects model (Tau 2 = 0.13, I 2 = 66%). All five studies reported fetal/infant mortality (Dugo 2018; Goya 2012; Hui 2013; Nicolaides 2016; Saccone 2017).It is unclear if cervical pessary compared with no treatment has an e ect on the risk of fetal/infant mortality because the 95% CI is compatible with a wide range of e ects that encompass both appreciable benefit and harm (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.48; 5 studies, 1830 infants; lowcertainty evidence; Analysis 1.8; Summary of findings 1). Three studies measured neonatal sepsis (Goya 2012; Hui 2013; Nicolaides 2016).It is unclear if cervical pessary compared with no treatment has an e ect on the risk of neonatal sepsis (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.96; Tau 2 = 0.61; I 2 = 69%; 3 studies, 1412 infants; Analysis 1.9).Because of substantial heterogeneity, we used the random-e ects model (Tau 2 = 0.52, I 2 = 69%). Two studies reported gestational age at birth as means and SDs (Goya 2012; Hui 2013).It is unclear if cervical pessary compared with no treatment has an e ect on gestational age at birth (MD 1.63 weeks, 95% CI -0.82 to 4.07; I 2 = 90%; 2 studies, 488 infants; Analysis 1.10).Because of substantial heterogeneity, we used the randome ects model (Tau 2 = 0.52, I 2 = 90%). Nicolaides 2016 reported gestational age at birth as median and range, showing no di erence between cervical pessary and no treatment.Dugo 2018 reported this outcome as median and interquartile range (IQR), and found no significant di erence between the two groups: 37.2 weeks (IQR 30.0 to 39.1) in the Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews pessary group versus 38.1 weeks (IQR 27.8 to 39.4) in the expectant management group. No studies reported harm to o spring from the intervention. Only Hui 2013 reported mean birthweight, showing no e ect of the intervention compared to the control (2.84 (SD 0.59) kg in the pessary group compared with 2.95 (SD 0.74) kg in the no treatment group).Three studies reported birthweight in two categories, less than 2500 g and less than 1500 g. (Goya 2012; Nicolaides 2016; Saccone 2017).These individual studies showed no significant di erence between the groups in terms of birthweight categories. No studies reported late neurodevelopmental morbidity. Four studies reported necrotising enterocolitis (Dugo 2018; Goya 2012; Nicolaides 2016; Saccone 2017).It is unclear if cervical pessary compared to no treatment has an e ect on necrotising enterocolitis (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.51; I 2 = 0%; 4 studies, 1722 infants; Analysis 1.12). Two studies reported bronchopulmonary dysplasia (Dugo 2018; Saccone 2017).It is unclear if cervical pessary compared to no treatment has an e ect on the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.52; I 2 = 0%; 2 studies, 418 infants; Analysis 1.13). All five studies in this comparison reported respiratory distress syndrome (RDS).No study provided evidence of an e ect of the intervention on RDS, but we did not meta-analyse these data, as RDS was not among our secondary outcomes. Three studies provided data for this comparison (Care 2021; Cruz-Melguizo 2018; Pacagnella 2022). Three studies reported delivery before 34 weeks\\' gestation (Care 2021; Cruz-Melguizo 2018; Pacagnella 2022).Cervical pessary compared with vaginal progesterone probably reduces the risk of delivery before 34 weeks (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.02; 3 studies, 1126 women; moderate-certainty evidence; Analysis 2.1; Summary of findings 2).However, as the 95% CI crosses the line of no e ect, we cannot rule out a slight increase in this outcome. Delivery before 37 weeks\\' gestation: Three studies reported delivery before 37 weeks\\' gestation (Care 2021; Cruz-Melguizo 2018; Pacagnella 2022).Cervical pessary compared with vaginal progesterone probably reduces the risk of delivery before 37 weeks (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.09; 3 studies, 1126 women; moderate-certainty evidence; Analysis 2.2; Summary of findings 2).However, as the 95% CI crosses the line of no e ect, we cannot rule out a slight increase in this outcome. No studies reported maternal mortality. Two studies reported maternal infection or inflammation (Care 2021; Cruz-Melguizo 2018).Cervical pessary compared with vaginal progesterone probably has little or no e ect on the risk of vaginal infection (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.12; 2 studies, 265 women; moderate-certainty evidence; Analysis 2.3; Summary of findings 2). Two studies reported preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (Care 2021; Cruz-Melguizo 2018).It is unclear if cervical pessary compared to vaginal progesterone has an e ect on preterm prelabour rupture of membranes because the 95% CI is compatible with a wide range of e ects that encompass both appreciable benefit and harm (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.97; 2 studies, 265 women; I 2 = 0%; Analysis 2.4). No studies reported harm to women from the intervention. This outcome included tocolytic treatment, corticosteroid administration for lung maturity and antibiotics for positive vaginal swab.Data from Care 2021 and Cruz-Melguizo 2018 showed no clear di erence between cervical pessary and vaginal progesterone as regards tocolytic treatment (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.49; 2 studies, 265 women; I 2 = 0%; Analysis 2.5) or corticosteroid treatment (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.51to 1.28; 2 studies, 265 women; Analysis 2.5). Only Care 2021 reported antibiotic use for positive vaginal swab, showing no di erence between the groups (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.01 to 5.79; 1 study, 11 women; Analysis 2.5) Cruz-Melguizo 2018 reported discontinuation in 4/128 cervical pessary users.Reported reasons were significant vaginal discomfort in two woman, intense vaginal bleeding in one woman and repeated expulsion of the pessary in one multiparous women (Analysis 2.6). No studies reported maternal satisfaction. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Neonatal/paediatric care unit admission Only Care 2021 measured neonatal sepsis, reporting no cases among 11 infants (Analysis 2.9). No studies reported gestational age at birth. Only Care 2021 measured harm to o spring from the intervention, reporting no cases among 11 infants (low-certainty evidence; Analysis 2.10; Summary of findings 2). No studies reported birthweight. In Cruz-Melguizo 2018, 2/128 infants in the cervical pessary group had early neurodevelopmental morbidity (retinopathy), compared with 1/126 in the vaginal progesterone group (Analysis 2.11). No studies reported late neurodevelopmental morbidity. In Cruz-Melguizo 2018, 2/128 infants in the cervical pessary group had necrotising enterocolitis, compared with 0/126 in the vaginal progesterone group (Analysis 2.12). In Cruz-Melguizo 2018 7/128 infants in the cervical pessary group had respiratory morbidity, compared with 6/126 in the vaginal progesterone group (Analysis 2.13). Only Care 2021 provided data for this comparison. Care 2021 reported no cases of delivery before 34 weeks in either arm of the study (low-certainty evidence; Analysis 3.1; Summary of findings 3). Delivery before 37 weeks\\' gestation Care 2021 reported 2/6 deliveries before 37 weeks in the cervical pessary group versus 0/7 in the control group (low-certainty evidence; Analysis 3.2; Summary of findings 3). Care 2021 did not report maternal mortality. In Care 2021, 2/6 women in the cervical pessary group had vaginal infection versus 2/7 in the cervical cerclage group (very lowcertainty evidence; Analysis 3.3; Summary of findings 3). In Care 2021, 3/6 women in the cervical pessary group and 1/7 in the cervical cerclage group had prelabour rupture of membranes (Analysis 3.4). Care 2021 did not report harm to women from the intervention. One woman in each arm of Care 2021 received tocolytic treatment.Corticosteroid stimulation of lung maturity was administered to 3/6 women in the cervical pessary group and 1/7 women in the cervical cerclage group.No women in the cervical pessary group received antibiotics due to a positive vaginal swab, compared with 2/7 women in the cervical cerclage group (Analysis 3.5). Care 2021 reported that 0/6 women in the pessary group discontinued the intervention, while one of the seven women with cervical cerclage had it removed when she progressed to active preterm labour at 25 weeks\\' gestation. Care 2021 did not report maternal satisfaction. Neonatal/paediatric care unit admission Care 2021 did not report neonatal/paediatric care unit admission. Care 2021 reported no deaths among the six infants in the cervical pessary group, and one death among the seven infants in the cervical cerclage group (low-certainty evidence; Analysis 3.7; Summary of findings 3). There were no reported cases of neonatal sepsis in either group (Analysis 3.8). Care 2021 did not report gestational age at birth. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. There were no reported cases of harm to o spring from the intervention in either group (Analysis 3.9). Care 2021 did not report birthweight. Care 2021 did not report early neurodevelopmental morbidity. Care 2021 did not report late neurodevelopmental morbidity. Care 2021 did not report late neurodevelopmental morbidity. Care 2021 did not report late neurodevelopmental morbidity. We included eight RCTs in this review; one was a three-arm study that contributed data to more than one comparison. Five RCTs compared cervical pessary to no treatment, three studies compared cervical pessary to vaginal progesterone, and one study compared cervical pessary to cervical cerclage.All studies took place in high-income countries and met the criteria for trustworthiness according to the Pregnancy and Childbirth scientific integrity checklist.Risk of bias assessment showed low risk of bias in all domains except for performance and detection biases, as most studies were open-label.We also identified 16 registered ongoing RCTs evaluating cervical pessary in pregnant women with a short cervix for prevention of PTB in singleton pregnancy (see Characteristics of ongoing studies table).We will assess these ongoing studies for inclusion in the first update of this review. The current evidence suggests that cervical pessary compared with no treatment may reduce the risk of delivery before 34 weeks or before 37 weeks compared with no treatment (low-certainty evidence), although these results should be viewed with caution because the 95% CIs cross the line of no e ect. Cervical pessary compared with no treatment probably results in little or no di erence in the risk of vaginal infection.Vaginal discharge and chorioamnionitis were not among our prespecified outcomes; however, it seems that cervical pessary compared with no treatment probably increases the risk of vaginal discharge, and may make little or no di erence to the risk of chorioamnionitis, although the wide 95% CI indicates the possibility of either increased risk or reduced risk. Regarding outcomes related to o spring, it is unclear if cervical pessary compared with no treatment has an e ect on neonatal/ paediatric care unit admission, fetal/neonatal mortality or neonatal sepsis, because the 95% CIs are compatible with a wide range of e ects that encompass both appreciable benefit and harm.In addition, the use of cervical pessary did not a ect the birthweight of the newborns in individual studies. The evidence suggests that cervical pessary use compared with vaginal progesterone may reduce the risk of preterm delivery before 34 weeks and before 37 weeks (moderate-certainty evidence), although these results should be viewed with caution because the 95% CIs cross the line of no e ect.Cervical pessary compared with vaginal progesterone probably has little or no e ect on the risk of vaginal infection.Only one study reported neonatal/ paediatric care unit admission and infant mortality, providing uncertain evidence. Only one study with a very small sample size was eligible for inclusion in this comparison.It was a feasibility study with few events, and the evidence is insu icient to generate any conclusions. In the protocol for this review, we stated that we aimed to compare cervical pessary with four comparators: no treatment, vaginal progesterone, cervical cerclage and bed rest (Abdel-Aleem 2019). We reviewed the search results against explicit criteria.We included eight RCTs, which provided data for three comparisons: cervical pessary versus no treatment (five studies), vaginal progesterone (three studies) and cervical cerclage (one study). Among the five studies that evaluated cervical pessary versus no treatment, we observed substantial heterogeneity for the primary outcome (delivery before 34 weeks\\' gestation; Analysis 1.1).However, the evidence suggested that the pessary use may decrease the risk of delivery before 34 weeks (low-certainty evidence; Summary of findings 1).The studies provided data for only some of our prespecified outcomes: no studies reported maternal satisfaction, and between one and four studies reported the remaining maternal outcomes.No studies reported the o spring outcomes of harm to o spring from the intervention or late neurodevelopmental morbidity.The remaining eight outcomes were variably reported in one to four of the studies, although we could not meta-analyse the data on birthweight (Analysis 1.7; Analysis 1.8; Analysis 1.9; Analysis 1.10; Analysis 1.11; Analysis 1.12; Analysis 1.13).In the key outcomes, the certainty of evidence varied from low to moderate (Summary of findings 1). We observed substantial heterogeneity among primary outcome data from the three studies that evaluated cervical pessary versus vaginal progesterone, though the evidence suggested that the intervention may reduce the rate preterm delivery before 34 weeks (Analysis 2.1; Summary of findings 2).Between one and three studies provided data for five of eight maternal secondary outcomes and seven of 10 o spring secondary outcomes (Analysis 2.2; Analysis 2.3; Analysis 2.4; Analysis 2.5; Analysis 2.6; Analysis 2.7; Analysis 2.8; Analysis 2.9; Analysis 2.10; Analysis 2.11; Analysis 2.12; Analysis 2.13).In the key outcomes, the certainty of evidence varied from low to moderate (Summary of findings 2). We met our objective of assessing the e ect of cervical pessary in prevention of preterm labour in high-risk cases, specifically in comparison to no treatment and progesterone treatment.However, we were unable to reach any conclusions on the e ects Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews of cervical cerclage, and we identified no studies using bed rest as a comparator. All included studies had low risk of selection bias because they used computer-generated random tables for sequence generation, and either sealed opaque envelopes or web-based systems for allocation concealment.All had low risk of attrition bias, with 1% to 2% loss to follow-up, which is to be expected in a sample of pregnant women.Seven studies were considered at high risk of performance and detection biases because they were openlabel.The authors of one study, tried to blind the participants in the control group by simulating pessary insertion during a digital examination (Hui 2013 ).However, we do not consider this complete blinding because women can feel the pessary in their vagina.Two studies were terminated before reaching the calculated sample size (Hui 2013 ; Nicolaides 2016).All studies followed preregistered protocols, so had low risk of reporting bias (Figure 2 ). We produced an additional table with further details of the studies included in the first comparison (cervical pessary versus no treatment); it shows marked diversity between the populations, interventions, outcomes reported and previous and current risk of PTB (Table 1 ).It seems that the included studies examined di erent phenotypes of PTB, which could help to explain the heterogeneity among the results. We included seven key outcomes in our summary of findings tables. In the first comparison (cervical pessary versus no treatment), we downgraded the certainty of four key outcomes (delivery before 34 weeks, delivery before 37 weeks, neonatal/paediatric care unit admission, fetal/infant mortality) by two levels to low, and we downgraded the certainty of the evidence for maternal infection and inflammation by one level to moderate (Summary of findings 1).No studies reported harm to o spring or birthweight in this comparison.In the second comparison (cervical pessary versus vaginal progesterone), we downgraded the three maternal outcomes (delivery before 34 weeks and 37 weeks and maternal infection or inflammation) by one level to moderate-certainty evidence, and we downgraded three neonatal outcomes (neonatal/ paediatric care unit admission, fetal/infant mortality, harm to o spring) by two levels to low-certainty evidence (Summary of findings 2).No studies reported birthweight in this comparison. With regard to the third comparison (cervical pessary versus cervical cerclage, based on only one study), we downgraded the certainty of the evidence for delivery before 34 weeks and 37 weeks, fetal/infant mortality and harm to o spring by two levels to low, and we downgraded the certainty of the evidence for maternal infection and inflammation by three levels to very low (Summary of findings 3).The single study in this comparison did not report neonatal/paediatric care unit admission or birthweight. We used predefined criteria to assess the scientific integrity/ trustworthiness of the studies.Although nine studies met our eligibility criteria, we moved one of them to studies awaiting classification a er this trustworthiness assessment (Karbasian 2016).This decision was based on lack of prospective registration and ethics committee approval.We attempted to contact the study authors via Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth, but received no response.If we obtain the necessary data, we will include Karbasian 2016 in the first update of this review. The available data covered three comparisons (cervical pessary versus no treatment, vaginal progesterone and cervical cerclage); we identified no studies for the comparison of cervical pessary versus bed rest. In the first comparison (cervical pessary versus no treatment) we found substantial heterogeneity between included studies.In Goya 2012 and Saccone 2017, the pessary helped to prevent PTB, while Dugo 2018, Hui 2013 and Nicolaides 2016 found no benefit.We attempted to explain the heterogeneity among the included studies through subgroup analysis (by type of pessary, as prespecified in the protocol) and sensitivity analyses (repeating the analyses a er excluding studies with progesterone cointervention). Neither approach explained the heterogeneity.We examined the clinical diversity of the studies included in the first comparison, in terms of the populations, interventions and outcome reporting in relation to the prespecified outcomes (Table 1 ).We detected marked clinical diversity in all domains, which could explain part of the heterogeneity. We noticed extreme degrees of variability in the incidence of the primary outcome (delivery before 34 weeks) between the included RCTs in both study arms.Four studies used Arabin pessaries, while Dugo 2018 used the Bioteque cup.However, the subgroup analysis suggested that type of pessary had no e ect on the primary outcome.Moreover, the exclusion of studies with the progesterone cointervention did not seem to make any di erence in the sensitivity analysis (Table 1 ).Since we included fewer than 10 studies in this comparison, we did not perform metaregression to explain heterogeneity. Another limitation of the review is that the definitions of the outcomes were mainly based on CROWN consensus and do not exactly match those defined in the included studies (van \\'t Hoo 2016).This limited the number of reported outcomes in relation to prespecified outcomes.Moreover, outcomes such as chorioamnionitis, vaginal discharge or neonatal RDS, which were not prespecified in the CROWN consensus, are of clinical importance in this population.In addition, some studies reported outcomes in units other than those specified in the review and could not be included in the analysis. In the second comparison (cervical pessary versus vaginal progesterone), we found substantial heterogeneity among studies Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for the primary outcome.While Pacagnella 2022 reported a reduction in delivery before 34 weeks in the pessary group, Care 2021 and Cruz-Melguizo 2018 did not.The reasons outlined above for the first comparison could explain the heterogeneity between studies. We identified 16 registered ongoing studies.The publication of results has been delayed in many cases, which reflects the di iculty of conducting RCTs in this area (Characteristics of ongoing studies). Despite the diversity of data included in our meta-analysis, overall there is evidence of a possible reduction in the risk of delivery before 34 weeks or 37 weeks with the use of cervical pessary compared with no treatment or vaginal progesterone, although the results of all of these meta-analysis do not rule out the possibility of no e ect or a small increase in PTB.One previous Cochrane Review on this topic included both singleton and twin pregnancy and identified only one eligible study (Goya 2012); the evidence suggested that cervical pessary may reduce PTB compared no treatment, in line with our results (Abdel-Aleem 2013). However, our findings contradict those of Jin 2017, a review that included three RCTs in the comparison of cervical pessary versus no treatment and showed no benefit of the pessary (Goya 2012; Hui 2013; Nicolaides 2016).Our results also di er from those of Correa 2019, which included five RCTs and found that cervical pessary was not superior to no treatment (Goya 2012; Hui 2013; Karbasian 2016; Nicolaides 2016; Saccone 2017).Additionally, a network metaanalysis by Jarde and colleagues included four RCTs (Goya 2012; Hui 2013; Nicolaides 2016; Saccone 2017), and found that there was insu icient evidence to reach conclusions for the comparisons of cervical pessary versus cervical cerclage, vaginal progesterone and bed rest (Jarde 2019) .Regarding the comparison with no intervention or treatment as usual, Jarde 2019 found that cervical pessary had little or no e ect on prevention of delivery before 34 weeks, but may have reduced delivery before 37 weeks.Our systematic review showed a potential protective e ect of cervical pessary compared to no treatment in prevention of delivery before 34 weeks or 37 weeks, but with very marked heterogeneity and wide CIs that crossed the line of no e ect.Another meta-analysis by Perez-Lopez and colleagues included only three studies (Goya 2012; Nicolaides 2016; Saccone 2017), and found that cervical pessary compared with no treatment did not reduce delivery before 34 weeks but did reduce delivery before 37 weeks (Perez-Lopez 2019). The di erence with our review is that Perez-Lopez 2019 did not include two studies that showed no e ect of cervical pessary on PTB (Dugo 2018; Hui 2013). The diversity of results on the e ectiveness of cervical pessary may be related to di erent phenotypes of PTB.One retrospective study found that in women with short cervix and previous preterm prelabour rupture of membranes, cervical pessary may be a less e ective option (Care 2019).This study highlighted the importance of the phenotype of previous PTB for predicting the treatment e ect.Future clinical trials should take this information into account. Regarding the second comparison (cervical pessary versus vaginal progesterone), our results di er from those of one meta-analysis by Liu and colleagues (Liu 2019) .It included three RCTS (Karbasian 2016; Nicolaides 2016; Saccone 2017), and found that combined treatment (pessary plus progesterone) was not superior to progesterone alone in prevention of delivery before 34 weeks (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.77).Di erences in the phenotypes of PTB and ethnic background of participants may explain the di ering results. In women with singleton pregnancy and risk factors for cervical insu iciency, cervical pessary compared to no treatment or vaginal progesterone may reduce the risk of delivery before 34 weeks or 37 weeks of gestation, although these results should be viewed with caution due to uncertainty around the e ect estimates.There is insu icient evidence with regard to the e ect of cervical pessary versus cervical cerclage. Due to the low certainty of evidence in most of the prespecified outcomes and non-reporting of other outcomes, there is a need for further robust randomised clinical trials that use standardised terminology for maternal and o spring outcomes. There is also a need for data from lower-income countries to ensure generalisability.Further research should concentrate on comparisons of cervical pessary versus cervical cerclage and bed rest.Investigation of di erent phenotypes of preterm birth could be of importance.

Uterus transplantation has provided women with AUFI the first true fertility treatment.With this procedure, unlike the use of gestational surrogacy, they can experience all aspects of natural motherhood, including not only the genetic tie but also the experience of pregnancy and childbirth.Moreover, although gestational surrogacy is an established option for women with AUFI to achieve genetic motherhood (and legal motherhood after adoption), this option is not available for most women in the world, because most countries or societies do not allow gestational surrogacy for ethical, legal, and/or religious reasons (6) .Furthermore, in many of those countries that do permit gestational surrogacy, the practice is unregulated and has associated risks of carrier exploitation.Of note, surveys among women with AUFI have shown that UTx would be preferred over gestational surrogacy (7, 8) .Clearly, to many women, childbearing is considered important to motherhood. It is predicted that AUFI affects approximately 1:500 women of fertile age, with the most common causes being previous hysterectomy (cervical/uterine cancer, emergency peripartum procedure, and myoma); congenital absence; severe Asherman syndrome; and congenital uterine malformations, such as the unicornuate and didelphic uteri (9) .Today, modern infertility treatments, such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injections are considered routine clinical procedures, and in many countries, they are included in the public health care systems.For reasons of equity, it would be reasonable for UTx to become a covered treatment after proven success with acceptable complication rates in a country\\'s initial clinical trial(s).We emphasize that this would provide women with AUFI rights similar to infertility treatment as for those with other causes of infertility, such as tubal damage and endometriosis. It should be acknowledged that UTx is a complex infertility treatment that entails major investigations and procedures before and after surgical interventions.Whether involving \\'\\'Just because we can does not mean we should\\'\\'. \\'\\'This is.greatly complicated surgery .and it is not that we are terrible surgeons... even Dr.Takis, one of the absolute top transplant surgeons in the world, was caught by surprise..and says that this is possibly the most difficult transplantation he has ever done.\\'\\'-Br€ annstr€ om (19) This quote is by our esteemed colleague on the \\'\\'Pro\\'\\' side, Dr Mats Br€ annstr€ om, the leader of the first (3) and most experienced UTx team in the world (12) , referring to the complexity of harvesting the volunteer donor\\'s uterus.Dr Br€ annstr€ om expressing the unique difficulties and risks of UTx surgery, echoed vividly by experts worldwide who have attempted this feat (20, 21) , is a fitting entree to our \\'\\'Con\\'\\' discussion. Primum non nocera.As we make our case against UTx, we rely heavily on quotes from published experts, (occasionally adding emphasis); therefore, we again quote Dr Br€ annstr€ om referring to uterine donor hysterectomies: \\'\\'The first live liver transplantation took 24 h.. Today they do it in 6-9 h...I predict that the removal of the UTx operation will be reduced to as short as 5 to 6 h as surgeons become more experienced, with a corresponding decrease in the risk.\\'\\'-Br€ annstr€ om (19) . We assume that Dr Br€ annstr€ om was conveying optimism and not dismay in his belief to get the hysterectomy to \\'\\'as short as to 5 to 6 hours\\'\\' from 8-12 hours currently.Even this shorter, albeit yet unrealized goal, may be achievable for very few teams even with \\'\\'absolute top transplant surgeons,\\'\\' as they each experience steep learning curves trying to \\'\\'decrease.the risk\\'\\' to the volunteer uterine donors.A US team leader, commenting on their first birth after 3 failed transplants, stated \\'\\'We had a very rough start... who paid for it, in a certain way, were the first 3 women...\\'\\' Testa (22) . In the end, it must be acknowledged that the \\'\\'UTx does not newly offer women the opportunity to have a baby but rather to carry a pregnancy; this is an important distinction to understand,\\'\\' Lefkowitz et al. (23) .It is, in fact, an opportunity to participate in an extremely high-risk multistage endeavor.The newer promises of \\'\\'minimally invasive\\'\\' and robotic surgery are welcomed (24) but may have as much to do with cosmetics and surgeon fatigue than meaningful impact on the procedure\\'s morbidity and potential mortality. Thus, we agree that \\'\\'It is mandatory to discuss the advisability of UTx apart from its feasibility.\\'\\'Benagiano et al. (25) . Moreover, we join in asking that \\'\\'Are the risks of massive surgery, especially on a living donor, justified for what is arguably a \\'quality of life\\' transplant?\\'\\'Catsanos et al. (26) . Uterus transplantation is the first treatment for absolute uterine factor infertility: proven high success rates and continuing scientific evaluation (continued) Gestational surrogacy is the treatment for absolute uterine infertility (continued) either a live or a deceased donor, the surgical procedures are preceded by multiple laboratory tests, imaging, and multidisciplinary investigations of recipients and donors for purposes of exclusion of cases with a low chance of success.The livedonor hysterectomy, to isolate the uterus with long vascular pedicles, is probably the most complex existing gynecological surgery, and it typically has a duration of 8-12 hours (4, 5) .Transplantation in the recipient is a fast procedure with a typical duration of 4-6 hours (4, 5) .Postoperative in-hospital care typically lasts 4-7 days for live donors and recipients.The recipients are then observed by regular outpatient visits for gynecological examination, including cervical biopsies to detect rejection, and with an assessment of laboratory parameters, including concentrations of immunosuppressants. We also acknowledge that the surgical interventions and associated procedures required before, and for many years after UTx, can only be mastered by a very competent multidisciplinary team at a tertiary center with advanced gynecology, reproductive medicine, transplantation surgery, and obstetrics.However, such a multidisciplinary approach with institutional stability to maintain long-term care is not specific to UTx but is essential for any major surgical innovations, according to the Moore criteria (10) .Of note, the use of a gestational surrogate (GS) likewise requires a multidisciplinary team approach as well as the obvious requirement to find a woman willing, and medically cleared, to gestate another\\'s child.It should be noted that there is a clear upward trend in the number of UTx cases performed worldwide, and with optimization of surgical techniques as well as standardization of screening for inclusion/exclusion of donors and recipients, it is likely that the technique will spread rapidly with the initiation of scientific and clinical feasibility studies of UTx in each specific setting/nation. Uterus transplantation, unlike all other types of organ transplantation, has a considerable lag phase of over a year from the transplant until procedural success can be determined.Thus, a UTx procedure can only be regarded as truly successful when the grafted uterus has carried a pregnancy with the delivery of a live birth.The time from UTx until the first live birth may take several years, as illustrated by the world\\'s first deceased donor UTx procedure, which resulted in its first live birth 9 years later (11) . In UTx, the term surgical success is also used, which refers to a graft showing normal blood flow after transplantation and with regular menstruation, typically assessed around 3-4 months after surgery.A surgically successful UTx procedure will undergo the first embryo transfer (ET) from around 4-10 months after UTx, but naturally not all will achieve a live birth after multiple ET attempts.In the most updated comprehensive review article of 70 UTx cases (5) , the total surgical The normalization of deviance.The Harvard Business Review paper, \\'\\'How to Avoid Catastrophe,\\'\\' is applicable here (27) .The investigators reviewed how acting on several, foreseeable smaller problems when they occur can avert larger disasters later like the Challenger shuttle and BP oil spill, among others.They discuss how \\'\\'the normalization of deviance-the tendency over time to accept the development of anomalies, especially risky ones-takes hold\\'\\' and \\'\\'outcome bias-people observing successful outcomes focus on the results more than on the complex process or often the luck leading to the outcome.\\'\\'Such, we believe, is the case with UTx.Over a short time, deviations of significant risks to volunteer donors (and recipients and offspring) have been normalized, and we have come to accept the outcome bias of these unacceptable risks.Consideration of UTx for cis-gender males and transgender females may add further complexity and risk (28) .In considering UTx research and nonexperimental treatment, it is worth revisiting the Swedish regulation that \\'\\'biological material intended for transplant may not be taken from a living person if the operation can pose a serious risk to the donor\\'s life or health (29) .\\'\\' To avoid the risks to living donors, a handful of UTx worldwide have employed cadaver uteri.Dr Nuland\\'s UK team will only use cadaver uteri stating: \\'\\'This is not a lifesaving transplant.It is not the same as a heart, lung, liver, or kidney transplant\\'\\' (30) .Unfortunately, the inability to screen the uterus, cervix, vagina for contraindications (e.g., leiomyoma, dysplasia, and infection) before surgery, other issues of compatibility, timing, and availability present serious limitations to this option.The limitations are illustrated in the first US cadaver UTx, where, hours after a triumphant after surgical transplant press conference, the immunosuppressed recipient almost succumbed to Candidal sepsis via contamination from the deceased donor\\'s vaginal cuff (31) .The recipient couple later successfully used her mother as a GC.The limitations of pursuing cadaveric uteri have been deemed insurmountable by many proponents of transplantation, leading most centers to rely on living donors with its associated increased risks and complications (29) . We ask: when does seeking a lofty grail for perceived perfection among clinical options, e.g., \\'\\'a desire for not only my own child but my own pregnancy\\'\\' Catsanos et al. [26] ) become an enemy of the good?When must even the most prodigious of surgeons and well-meaning programs answer the call to nonmaleficence?New surgical grail.Setting aside the great exuberance of large multidisciplinary transplant teams across the globe, what are \\'\\'Pro\\'\\' transplant arguments and the counterarguments? 1. Pro: opportunity to carry one\\'s own child. Con: none -aiding those with Absolute Uterine Infertility (AIUF) to carry pregnancies of their own is a laudable goal. Uterus transplantation is the first treatment for absolute uterine factor infertility: proven high success rates and continuing scientific evaluation (continued) Gestational surrogacy is the treatment for absolute uterine infertility (continued) success of approximately 74% was reported, with success rates of 70% for live-donor UTx by laparotomy in both donor and recipient, 90% for live donor by minimal-invasive surgery (robotics/laparoscopy) in donor and laparotomy in recipients, and 58% for the deceased donor by laparotomy in donor and recipient.The high success rate for live-donor UTx by minimal-invasive surgery during donor hysterectomy is likely because the teams had previously acquired specific surgical skills with the use of conventional laparotomy methods. The reproductive efficacy of surgically successful grafts having ETs is typically assessed by the clinical pregnancy rate per ET and live birth rate per ET.Because the uterine graft will only be carried for a finite time (typically up to 5-6 years), the cumulative live birth rate resulting from the total number of ETs performed per attempted UTx procedure and surgically successful UTx procedure should be reported after uterine removal.There is only one trial with completed results and therefore the possibility to calculate the true key performance indices of IVF after UTx.In that trial, with 9 live-donor UTx procedures by laparotomy in 2012-2013, the overall clinical pregnancy rate per ET was 32.6%, and the livebirth rate per ET was 19.6% (12) .Although one could argue that these rates are low, it is to be noted that most ETs involved cleavagestage embryos and that one patient had as many as 16 ETs but no live birth.The cumulative live birth rates in the trial were 67% of performed UTx surgeries and 86% of surgically successful UTx procedures (12) . Taken together, although these results are encouraging and highlight the value of UTx in the treatment of AUFI, it is likely that success will further increase.Several procedural modifications are currently being performed or are under development, including refinements of inclusion criteria for donors and recipients, the introduction of minimally invasive surgery for donor hysterectomy, advancements in both noninvasive rejection diagnosis and immunosuppression protocols, and, in select cases, the use of blastocyst transfer with or without preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy. Most centers worldwide now performing clinical UTx do so within registered clinical trials and most of the results are published as case reports, interim analyses reporting surgical and reproductive outcomes, or are collated in reviews (5) .However, we have reached a time when results of single cases or small case series of UTx are uninformative because the novelty and scientific information gained from those are now so low.Moreover, even if these types of reports find their way to publication, there will be a risk of bias toward the publication of only successful cases resulting in live births.Thus, the time is now passed for 2. Pro: UTx represents the opportunity to carry a child where GS is believed to be exploitative, and unethical, and is then banned by law or custom. Con: \\'\\'GS offers a far from unproblematic remedy.butthese are all contingent matters.concernsthat are open to change.therefore,there are limits to which the current negative presumptions and unaccommodating laws for GS can legitimately be invoked as a basis for other \\'better\\' reproductive alternatives.onecould argue that the main objective ought to be to develop the law around GS rather than to develop reproductive alternatives\\'\\' (Catsanos et al. [26] ).A. Hastings report reasons: \\'\\'If one promoted benefit of UTx is reproductive autonomy, \\'autonomy\\' without allowing a choice is not providing reproductive autonomy at all\\'\\' Horsburgh [32] . It is patronizing for first world ethicists to conclude that GSs are inherently exploited, an argument used in support of bans.Interviews with many GSs provide alternative perspectives (33, 34) .One GS stated \\'\\'It takes me out of the tanning factory 10 hours days for 6 days per week.I am good at it and I can be of help.And I now can afford to feed, clothe, and educate my children.... Who\\'s exploiting who?\\'\\'And does UTx not exploit the uterine donors?And if some consider GS exploitation, then a response is regulate it within their countries (35) , such as discussion in Iceland (36) and Sweden (37, 38) , rather than ban it and default to supporting UTx (26, 38) . 3. Pro: GS represents a risk to the surrogate. \\'\\'Gestational Surrogacy raises major concerns about transferring the risk of pregnancy related morbidity and even mortality to another woman.\\'\\'-Olausson et al. (39) . Con: we believe this argument from Dr. Br€ annstr€ om\\'s team -and considering GS as an \\'\\'insult to human dignity\\'\\' (39)-are overstatements.The Nordic Maternal Mortality rates in all pregnancies (not just those well screened, successful gravidas who serve as GSs) (40) is hundreds of times lower than reported risks of the closest analogous surgery to a live donor\\'s hysterectomy, the far shorter (approximately 2.5-3 hours) and less complex radical hysterectomy. (41, 42) Olausson\\'s quote above (39) becomes a valid argument against UTx if one turns it on itself: It is UTx that \\'\\'raises major concerns about transferring the risks of morbidity and even mortality to another woman,\\'\\' (the uterine donor). The actual risks to the donor are detailed by Forbes and Karp (43) who state that \\'\\'the claim by Johannesson 2022 (13) that the data demonstrate safety for the recipient, living donor and child Uterus transplantation is the first treatment for absolute uterine factor infertility: proven high success rates and continuing scientific evaluation (continued) Gestational surrogacy is the treatment for absolute uterine infertility (continued) reviews or systematic reviews to provide reliable metrics on UTx. The ISUTx was formed in 2017 as a society with a vision dedicated to scientific scrutiny and clinical innovation and advances in the field of UTx.One major mission of the ISUTx, which is now a section in the globally spanning society, the Transplantation Society, is to establish and maintain an international registry of UTx cases. The first report of the ISUTx registry was recently published and includes data up until January 1, 2021, from all centers worldwide, except those of the United States (3 centers) and India (1 center).This report (4) was purely descriptive, providing valuable data on donors, recipients, surgery, immunosuppression, rejection, and live birth(s).With further expansion of data collected and with the regular publication of registry reports, the ISUTx is poised to provide current, reliable information, not only to teams performing or planning UTx but also to other stakeholders, such as patients, health politicians, and health insurance providers.Importantly, the prospective data entry and absence of identifiers linked to single UTx centers will minimize the risk of exclusion of cases with poor outcomes.The ISUTx is actively working toward achieving near-full coverage of all centers performing UTx, which will be instrumental in future developments of the registry and advancements in the field.With more cases entered, analyses will not only be descriptive but will be quantitative and allow investigators to involve multivariate and logistic regression analyses to identify variables that either positively or negatively impact UTx surgical and clinical success. With >45 children born from approximately 90 transplantations, the feasibility of UTx has been proven.The establishment of the ISUTx registry and prospective reporting for most cases worldwide will enable more robust analyses of reliable data and is expected to increase the awareness of UTx as a real alternative to gestational surrogacy.Together with increasing standardization of the procedure, we believe that access will increase and that UTx will become part of the armamentarium of reproductive specialists when counseling patients regarding their alternatives.As such, it will represent a realistic option for patients experiencing uterine infertility, and so will be consistent with survey results indicating that this is a woman\\'s preferred option to gestational surrogacy. is not accurate.\\'\\'the rate of surgical complications was relatively high for living donors, including 23% with grade III Clavien-Dindo complications (e.g., most requiring surgical intervention) and 14% with ureteral injury\\'\\' during the 10-14 hour surgery; and the \\'\\'immunosuppression regimen is intense.\\'\\'Those are serious complications in approximately 1 in 4 donor volunteers.\\'\\'Issues of safety, ethics and policy for this nascent procedure should be of active interest and continuous assessment and refinement\\'\\'-Forbes and Karp (43)-before practitioners, through the normalization of deviance, drift into acceptance of Clavien-Dindo grade III complications.Will only a donor\\'s tragic death force a recognition of these deviances? Risk to donors.The risks to the live volunteer uterine donors outlined above (especially compared with that of a GS) challenge the most foundational principle of medical bioethics: \\'\\'Primum non nocera\\'\\': First do no harm.Not second.Not third, but first (39) . Risks to recipients.Although recipients are the beneficiaries of UTx, there are many interventions and risks to them in this multistep process: first, cycles of IVF/embryo biopsy to store an adequate number of euploid embryos for transfer; intense, continuous immunotherapy; major and prolonged transplant surgery; ET cycle(s); gestation with ongoing careful monitoring for graft rejection; psychological risks, such as guilt for graft failure, pregnancy loss, or prematurity; possible disappointment with the reality of a physical pregnancy without innervation; Cesarean delivery (more than once if seeking a second pregnancy), then, finally, hysterectomy of this, the world\\'s first ephemeral transplant graft. Risks to the child.The risks to offspring being carried in a transplanted uterus include exposure to intense immunosuppressive drugs throughout gestation.In many documented cases (13) , there was also need for greater bolus doses and different immunosuppressive regimens mid gestation to avoid the risk of, or actualization of, uterine rejection, vascular insufficiency, and/or morbidity or mortality because of intrauterine growth retardation and/or prematurity -especially compared with gestation in a screened gravida (38) .The exposure of the developing fetus to immunosuppressive medications throughout gestation may also have unforeseen health consequences, such as transgenerational epigenetic effects, (44) the consequences of which may not be known for decades. Uterus transplantation is the first treatment for absolute uterine factor infertility: proven high success rates and continuing scientific evaluation (continued) Gestational surrogacy is the treatment for absolute uterine infertility (continued) Access, autonomy, and affirmation are paramount in the case of uterus transplantation Elliott G. Richards, M.D., Ph.D. Rebecca Flyckt, M.D. With success now replicated by dozens of centers around the world, UTx represents a long-anticipated method for achieving gestational motherhood for women affected by uterine factor infertility (UFI) (13) .As elegantly discussed by Drs Br€ annstr€ om and Racowsky in their section of this Fertile Battle, the growing worldwide experience is reassuring regarding the safety, efficacy, and neonatal outcomes after UTx.However, supporting arguments for UTx vs. gestational carriers (GCs) should not focus strictly on procedural outcomes; as described previously (14) , the motivations for participating in UTx are diverse and center on access to family-building modalities, perceived autonomy, and control over reproductive decision-making, and gender affirmation. Before delving into the \\'\\'Pro\\'\\' UTx side, it is worth mentioning that comparisons of UTx vs. GC are theoretical rather than practical in many parts of the world as GCs are illegal, banned, or inaccessible in many countries.For affected individuals living in these areas, the debate is better framed as UTx vs. acceptance of a life without biologic children.Unsurprisingly, Concerns regarding informed consent. \\'\\'Much research shows that innovative procedures like UTx may compromise valid informed and voluntary consent .leading to concerns for meeting the appropriately stringent ethical requirements of informed consent\\'\\' -(Catsanos et al. [26] ). Space constraints do not allow a robust exposition of important concerns about the informed consent process for uterine donors (e.g., often older relatives under pressure to participate) or for recipients (as there is risk to \\'\\'conflating research with therapy\\'\\') (21) , but the offspring/child must be more fully considered.The unborn cannot give consent or cannot choose by whom they are to be carried-GS vs. UTx-and the different degrees of risks to them from each option.It is the parent electing to place the child at greater risk by carriage after UTx so that they, the parent, can have the benefits of gestating their offspring.This choice by the parent(s) may be opposite to what the child would choose for themselves. Although contemporary ethicists provide parental latitude regarding the risks they chose to expose their unborn children, these certainly have limits, especially in non-life-saving treatment with substantive risks.If still, as Lefkowitz et al. (23) state almost quaintly today, \\'\\'the \\'standard of care\\' for women with UFI who wish to have a baby is to offer adoption services and surrogacy options,\\'\\'; who speaks for the child when parents choose beyond these standards? Concerns regarding utilization of limited research dollars. \\'\\'What can we afford to do considering the lack of resources for medical care and cures?\\'\\'-Olausson et al. (39) . \\'\\'Currently, uterine transplants have extremely low chances of success: it is then hardly justifiable to massively invest in such possibility, blocking the limited financial resources toward procedures with higher success rates.\\'\\'-Zaami et al. (45) . To date, publications have centered on only the experienced, \\'\\'best-in-class\\'\\' multidisciplinary teams, some >70 members!(including reproductive endocrinology, embryology, gynecology surgeons, immunologists, transplant surgeons, vascular surgeons, ethicists, nursing, neonatology, Intensive Care Unit (ICU), Labor and Delivery (L&D), Maternal and Fetal Medicine (MFM), anesthesia, pathologists, transplant psychologists, and among others).The magnitude and scope of medical resources, time, and expenses are massive.(3) A formal Cost Effectiveness Analysis comparing UTx and GS demonstrates the cost disparity per live birth of nearly $5.82M for UTx versus $270,859 for GS (46) .Few of even these most experienced teams have performed more than a half dozen transplants each under Uterus transplantation is the first treatment for absolute uterine factor infertility: proven high success rates and continuing scientific evaluation (continued) Gestational surrogacy is the treatment for absolute uterine infertility (continued) the initial attempts at UTx occurred in Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Sweden, countries with very restricted access to surrogacy.Even in the United States, surrogacy laws and accessibility vary widely by state. Looking at more permissive states and parts of the world, both costs and wait times for GC have increased in recent years, with estimated costs in the United States for GC ranging from $100,000-$200,000 (15) .Although the exact reason for rising expenses involved in GC cycles is unknown, it is likely related to increased agency charges, national health insurance trends that necessitate supplemental GC obstetric coverage, and carrier compensation.In contrast, the costs associated with UTx are predicted to decrease alongside surgical refinements and workflow efficiencies for procurement, transplant, and pregnancy.In some countries abroad, UTx itself is covered through government-sponsored insurance.Commercially-offered UTx in the United States is quoted at $150,000-$300,000 inclusive of medications, IVF, surgery, immunosuppression, pregnancy, delivery, and hysterectomy (L.Johannesson, personal communication, March 8, 2023) .Obstetric care is typically supported by insurance plans after UTx, in contrast with exclusions in insurance coverage for GC pregnancies in the United States.It should also be noted that a transplanted uterus (in most protocols) can be maintained to support up to 2 separate deliveries with incremental additional cost, whereas the high costs for a GC pregnancy typically recur with each consecutive pregnancy.These comparisons further underscore an equivalent if not a favorable cost profile per child associated with UTx vs. GC. Even if legality or cost were not a barrier to a GC, delays in matching intended parents with an appropriate GC present a significant hindrance.As most IVF medical directors know far too well, in the United States, the average wait time for a GC is currently at least one year, often extending the goal of childbirth out to 2 years from treatment initiation.Depending on whether UTx is planned with a living or deceased donor model, UTx donor-recipient matching can take weeks to months.Embryo transfer occurs as soon as 3-6 months after transplant (1) .Again, a comparison with GC is similar if not favored as a more expedient path to parenthood. The question of access is even more relevant for non-cisgender women.Transgender individuals face an array of challenges in accessing desired health services and encounter unique biases and barriers that are financial, legal, and cultural in nature.Especially, GCs may not engage with transgender individuals and their families owing to a lack of understanding and education, a fear of legal or financial complexities, and/ or concerns about potential impact within their own families and personal lives.If and when UTx is introduced as a treatment modality for UFI in transgender women, it may bypass obstacles to GC access in the same way that UTx offers a potential solution to the access issues encountered by cis-women worldwide (16) .current funding and protection granted by small clinical trial protocols.And then what? (24, 47) In recent Fertility and Sterility Reflections, members of one US UTx team pronounced that after \\'\\'just over 30 infants born worldwide, UTx is no longer theoretical (and many argue no longer experimental given that it has been performed outside of clinical trials)\\'\\' [Chung et al. (48) ].Giving voice to this argument is, in our view, disquieting.While the idea that \\'\\'many argue\\'\\' UTx is no longer considered experimental because some have decided to perform it outside the bounds of research trials seems circular and premature. We ask those aligned with the \\'\\'Pro\\'\\' side to tell us, given universal limited research resources, what other disease/disorder is denied research funding so that the massive research support for UTx may continue? (49) . \\'\\'To what extent should medicine delimit its potential in spite of societal desires?\\'\\'-Benagiano et al. (25) . If justice concerns the fair and equitable distribution of health resources, how can the high \\'\\'costs and access to care/disparities...\\'\\'-Forbes and Karp (42)-on the health care system for UTx be justified?And once research moves to the clinical application of UTx, who will have access?Who will not?Who can pay for the \\'\\'outrageously expensive\\'\\' (41) teams, set of procedures, anesthesia, and clinical care?(45) As \\'\\'...uterus transplantation opens up the possibility to treat the many young women with uterine factor infertility worldwide\\'\\'-Br€ annstr€ om et al. (3)-how can the many promises of this new intervention possibly be met?Will there become a market for uteri?(37) Or a donor chain (\\'\\'my kidney to your son for your uterus\\'\\') (28)?More likely it might well result only in justice denied unrealized beliefs of availability, access, and affordability (46) . \\'\\'Organ transplant remains an invasive procedure with significant risks related to the surgery itself, to rejection and to immunosuppression..thus each expansion of Transplantation Medicine\\'\\' (beyond life-saving transplants) challenges the ethical balance.\\'\\'-Catsanos et al. ( \\'\\'The ethical dilemma revolves around whether it is worth placing (three) lives at risk related to surgery and immunosuppression, amongst others, to enable a woman with AUFI to experience the presence of an organ enabling childbirth.\\'\\'-Taneja et al. (21) Uterus transplantation is the first treatment for absolute uterine factor infertility: proven high success rates and continuing scientific evaluation (continued) Gestational surrogacy is the treatment for absolute uterine infertility (continued) Autonomy: UTx is a Fertility Treatment That Prioritizes Reproductive Choice and Control Our modern era of patient autonomy and shared decisionmaking supports being inclusive of the voices of our patients as we discuss reproductive options for women with UFI.As illustrated above, the logistical obstacles to GC in the United States are significant.However, even beyond practical concerns, many patients find GCs undesirable because of the limitations surrounding reproductive choice and control. Prospective recipients of UTx identify the ability to participate actively in the prenatal health and well-being of their child as a key benefit of UTx that is not present in alternate methods of family building.Conversely, they associate the use of GC with a sense of helplessness and worry, centering on risks to their unborn child who they have little control over (14) .A Cleveland Clinic UTx recipient who had a previous child through gestational surrogacy described the experience of using a GS as \\'\\'traumatic\\'\\' (14) .For some women with UFI, surrogacy and adoption are not perceived as a \\'\\'benign\\'\\' or \\'\\'safer\\'\\' alternative to UTx; rather, these methods pose substantial and tangible risks to their emotional well-being, child, and family in ways not present with UTx.Women with UFI acknowledge the risks of UTx and welcome a shift in risk from others to themselves for transplantation, pregnancy, and fetal well-being.The potential negative outcomes of surrogacy and adoption are perceived to be significant enough to counterbalance and even outweigh, the known risks associated with UTx.As stated by one UTx recipient in Dallas: \\'\\'I was never born with this option.So for it to even be on the table was like, wow, I have the choice.Do I want a uterus?Do I want to try this?I had a choice which I never had been given when I was first diagnosed...So that was healing in itself\\'\\' (L. Johannesson, personal communication) . Uterus transplantation has been and continues to be driven by the perspective and unique needs of the UFI community.An online survey of the Mayer-Rokitansky-K€ uster-Hauser community, which included in-depth educational materials regarding the risks of the procedure, revealed that >73% of the respondents expressed a willingness to undergo UTx themselves, and >86% believed that it should be available as a choice for all women with UFI (17) .The investigators concluded that the Mayer-Rokitansky-K€ uster-Hauser community strongly desires that UTx be offered widely as an option for family building. Affirmation: UTx is a Gender-Affirming Treatment for Both Cis-and Trans-Women Although not a life-saving procedure, UTx is conceptually more than simply life-enhancing and indeed holds the potential for recipients to be life affirming and life propagating.Interviews with uterus transplant candidates revealed that they also perceived UTx to be a gender-affirming procedure-a Moreover, it is Dr. Br€ annstr€ om\\'s team that raises the fundamental question about their groundbreaking, yet troubling accomplishment: \\'\\'Of all that we do, what ought we to do?\\'\\' -Olausson et al. (39) . Our view is that, while GS is an imperfect solution to this heartrending medical and social challenge, compared with UTx, especially with live uterine donors, it is a far less problematic option. First, do no harm; interrupt the normalization of deviance; and, as our title states: \\'\\'Just because we can does not mean we should.\\'\\'Gestational surrogacy is an established and legitimate treatment for absolute uterine infertility in the United States Ginny L. Ryan, M.D., M.A. Gestational surrogacy is a form of family building made possible by IVF in which a GC agrees to have a genetically unrelated embryo or embryos transferred to their uterus for the purpose of carrying and delivering a pregnancy for an intended parent or parents.The embryo(s) are usually derived from intended parent gametes but may also be derived from donor oocytes and/or donor sperm.The GC may or may not be related to the intended parent(s) and is typically screened for parity and low risk of perinatal complications.Gestational surrogacy allows people without a uterus and those for whom pregnancy is contraindicated or attempts to conceive unsuccessful to build a family outside of adoption. Gestational surrogacy is a treatment increasingly used in the United States, jumping from 1%-2.5% of IVF cycles (30,927 cycles) between 1999 and 2013 (the most recent published numbers) (50) .According to the National Assisted Reproductive Technology Surveillance System data from 2020, gestational surrogacy is currently offered by 90% of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-reporting IVF centers in the United States (51) .It is also increasingly supported by state law (52).Although each state handles gestational surrogacy differently, and some have no relevant legislation in place, most courts are favorable at present.Furthermore, Colorado, New York, Oregon, Washington, and Wyoming have all passed laws in the last 4 years that codify some manner of support for gestational surrogacy, including Uterus transplantation is the first treatment for absolute uterine factor infertility: proven high success rates and continuing scientific evaluation (continued) Gestational surrogacy is the treatment for absolute uterine infertility (continued) procedure that supports an enhanced sense of identity as a woman (14) . Understanding the impact of UFI is paramount to understanding the motivations of women seeking UTx.Absolute UFI is a life-framing experience for those affected, impacting an individual\\'s perception of acceptance by their familial and social networks, partners, and personal self-concept; in the words of one patient with UFI, it \\'\\'affected all aspects of my life [and] my family\\'s life\\'\\' (14) .This includes challenges related to initiating and sustaining romantic partnerships, specifically in relation to the timing and nature of disclosing their diagnosis and the uncertainties surrounding the reception or rejection of such information by a new or existing partner.Another Cleveland Clinic patient stated: \\'\\'I learned to adapt as to who I am.I believed before that I was not a woman, not a complete woman because I was missing that part.\\'\\' The transgender community has long sought UTx as a gender-affirming treatment in addition to infertility care.The history of Lili Elbe, a Danish transgender woman who underwent some of the first known gender-affirming surgeries in the early 20th century-including UTx-highlights the desire of individuals to have reproductive organs that align with their gender identity.For many transgender individuals, the gender-affirming aspect of UTx may be particularly profound because patients may experience life-defining distress arising from an incongruence between their felt gender and their assigned sex; there is significant interest in UTx by the transgender community (18) . To date, all recipients of UTx have been cis-gender women.However, the experiences of cis-gender women with UFI demonstrates that there are shared experiences and desires between the cis-and transgender communities when it comes to the appeal of UTx: UTx is seen as a means of restoring a sense of normalcy to one\\'s body in the setting of altered anatomy and function (14, 18) .As stated by one woman in the Baylor Dallas uterus transplant program: \\'\\'When you do not have a uterus you\\'re learning at such a young age... that it is not an option to have a child.It feels like your womanhood was taken away from you.It made me question my role as a woman\\'\\' (L.Johannesson, personal communication). Uterus transplantation is a viable option for women affected by UFI who desire gestational motherhood.Moreover, UTx compares favorably with GCs for timeline, cost, and accessibility and offers enhanced reproductive autonomy for patients with UFI.Furthermore, UTx efforts have been propelled forward by the unique needs, perspectives, and priorities of women with UFI and promotes shared decisionmaking, individualized treatment decisions, and reproductive choice.In addition, UTx is a gender-affirming treatment for but not limited to supporting the compensation of GCs and granting parental rights to the intended parents.There are several remaining states, including Indiana, Michigan, and Nebraska, in which surrogacy contracts are unenforceable or compensation is illegal, however.Owing to the dynamic nature of the law surrounding this treatment, it is a vital best practice that all parties in a gestational surrogacy arrangement have experienced independent legal representation. To assist in navigating legal and practical complexities, the Ethics and Practice Committees of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine provide clear guidance for IVF practices that provide gestational surrogacy treatment.This guidance includes how to incorporate minimal standards of practice from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the US Food and Drug Administration, and the American Association of Tissue Banks (53) .Guidance from the American Society for Reproductive Medicine also covers the psychological and medical selection and screening of GCs, screening for the intended parents, psychoeducational support for all parties, legal considerations, ET practices, and unique considerations when working with a family member as a GC (53) (54) (55) .Importantly, this guidance includes recently updated and focused guidance on consideration of the GC as an independent and autonomous individual and patient (54) . In 2019, the Committee on Ethics of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists also reaffirmed a guidance document generally supportive of gestational surrogacy if practical, legal, and ethical guidelines are followed by obstetrician and gynecologists who take part (56) .The Committee agreed on the particular importance that a GC\\'s autonomy and intrinsic value are respected and that their physical and emotional health, and legal rights, are considered independently.There has been much written about how financial compensation, and the level of compensation, may be either consistent or a strain on these considerations.Some ethicists, legislators, and other commentators have used the dichotomy of \\'\\'commercial\\'\\' vs. \\'\\'altruistic\\'\\' agreements to debate the propriety of this practice.Other experts have pointed to the importance of context-specific, virtual-ethical conditions over a commercial vs. altruistic dichotomy in deciding on the moral legitimacy of a particular gestational surrogacy agreement (57, 58) .Regardless of the lens applied, stakeholders in these treatment settings benefit from open discussion and professional guidance in the United States. Perhaps partly because of the acceptance and oversight of gestational surrogacy in the United States, US studies have suggested that most involved parties do very well medically and psychosocially.Pregnancy rates are typically better than rates resulting from other infertility treatments (50) .Obstetric complications are rare and less common than in other IVF pregnancies (although GCs may experience more risks in pregnancies with intended parents\\' embryos than in their other pregnancies) and birth defect rates seem similar to other IVF pregnancies (50, 59) . Uterus transplantation is the first treatment for absolute uterine factor infertility: proven high success rates and continuing scientific evaluation (continued) Gestational surrogacy is the treatment for absolute uterine infertility (continued) both cis-and transgender women, offering the potential to restore a sense of completeness to their bodies.The voices and desires of the UFI community should be central to debates and discussions surrounding their reproductive opportunities.It is our strong opinion that UTx should be available as an option for all women affected by UFI. Although relatively limited, studies conducted in the US and internationally suggest few issues with psychological wellbeing of GCs or intended parents after an initial transition, and no concerns for parent-child bonding (50, 58) .The experience is more likely to be ethically and legally fraught in transnational (also known as cross-border) relationships, where the cultural, legal, and economic context may result in challenges for both parties and risks to the autonomy and health of the GC (58, 60) . Transnational gestational surrogacy arrangements have developed in large part owing to the lack of regulation and availability worldwide, with the United States one of the very few countries in which compensated gestational surrogacy is legally supported (in most states) at present (50) .Thanks to the resulting national conversations on and study of this treatment in the United States, utilization has increased, outcomes research has improved, and professional guidance has evolved.Experience, theory, and data support the fact that gestational surrogacy is a safe and effective treatment option in this national setting for absolute uterine infertility.As Horsey and Mahmoud (60) state, \\'\\'[S]surrogacy is here to stay as a legitimate form of family building and should be supported and legitimized by government and health care providers alike.\\'\\'Uterus transplantation is the first treatment for absolute uterine factor infertility: proven high success rates and continuing scientific evaluation (continued) Gestational surrogacy is the treatment for absolute uterine infertility (continued) VOL. 119 NO. 6 / JUNE 2023 Fertility and Sterility®\\n\\n==================================================\\n\\nFile: Adenomyosis--single-cell-transcriptomic-analysis-r.grobid.tei.json\\nTitle: Adenomyosis: single-cell transcriptomic analysis reveals a paracrine mesenchymal–epithelial interaction involving the WNT/SFRP pathway\\nAuthors: Sule [] Yildiz, Meric [] Kinali, Jian [\\'Jun\\'] Wei, Magdy [] Milad, Ping [] Yin, Mazhar [] Adli, Serdar [\\'E\\'] Bulun\\nAbstract: Objective: To assess the cellular and molecular landscape of adenomyosis.Design: Single-cell analysis of genome-wide messenger RNA (mRNA) expression (single-cell RNA sequencing) of matched tissues of endometrium, adenomyosis, and myometrium using relatively large numbers of viable cells.Setting: Not applicable.Patient(s): Patients (n ¼ 3, age range 40-44 years) undergoing hysterectomy for diffuse adenomyosis.Main Outcome Measure(s): Definition of the molecular landscape of matched adenomyotic, endometrial and myometrial tissues from the same uterus using single-cell RNA sequencing and comparison of distinct cell types in these tissues to identify disease-specific cell populations, abnormal gene expression and pathway activation, and mesenchymal-epithelial interactions. The largest cell population in the endometrium was composed of closely clustered fibroblast groups, which comprise 36% of all cells and seem to originate from pericyte progenitors differentiating to estrogen/progesterone receptor-expressing endometrial stromal-cells.In contrast, the entire fibroblast population in adenomyosis comprised a larger (50%) portion of all cells and was not linked to any pericyte progenitors.Adenomyotic fibroblasts eventually differentiate into extracellular matrix protein-expressing fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells.Hierarchical clustering of mRNA expression revealed a unique adenomyotic fibroblast population that clustered transcriptomically with endometrial fibroblasts, suggestive of an endometrial stromal cell population serving as progenitors of adenomyosis.Four other adenomyotic fibroblast clusters with disease-specific transcriptomes were distinct from those of endometrial or myometrial fibroblasts.The mRNA levels of the natural WNT inhibitors, named, secreted frizzledrelated proteins 1, 2, and 4, were higher in these 4 adenomyotic fibroblast clusters than in endometrial fibroblast clusters.Moreover, we found that multiple WNTs, which originate from fibroblasts and target ciliated and unciliated epithelial cells and endothelial cells, constitute a critical paracrine signaling network in adenomyotic tissue.Compared with endometrial tissue, unciliated and ciliated epithelial cells in adenomyosis comprised a significantly smaller portion of this tissue and exhibited molecular evidence of progesterone resistance and diminished regulation of estrogen signaling. We found a high degree of heterogeneity in fibroblast-like cells in the adenomyotic uterus.The WNT signaling involving differential expression of secreted frizzled-related proteins, which act as decoy receptors for WNTs, in adenomyotic fibroblasts may have a key role in the pathophysiology of this disease.(\\nBody Text: denomyosis is an estrogen-dependent gynecologic disorder in which endometrial epithelial cells and stromal fibroblasts appear in the myometrium as islands surrounded by hypertrophic smooth muscle cells (1) (2) (3) .It is associated with heavy menstrual bleeding, dysmenorrhea, chronic pelvic pain, and infertility (3, 4) .The etiology and underlying mechanisms of adenomyosis have remained mostly unclear, although 2 main explanations have been proposed: invagination of the basal layer of the endometrium and metaplasia of M€ ullerian remnant progenitor cells inside the myometrium (1, 5) .Another explanation, proposed by Leyendecker, describes a \\'\\'tissue injury and repair\\'\\' mechanism that is activated by hyperestrogenism and hyperperistalsis leading to uterine autotraumatization (6, 7) .According to the tissue injury and repair theory, adenomyosis arises from a vicious cycle involving hyperestrogen-initiated local injury that leads to increased production of prostaglandin E2, hyperperistalsis, and trauma at the archimetria (endometrial glands, endometrial stroma, and subendometrial myometrium), endometrial invagination, and chronic inflammation, which leads to further local hyperestrogenism (1, (7) (8) (9) . In its advanced stages, the disease imitates malignancy, not in terms of histology but by its clinical course.The unclear etiology and lack of effective medical therapy make adenomyosis a challenging clinical disorder.It is clear, however, that estrogen is essential for the growth of ectopic endometrium outside the uterus (1, 5) .Therefore, medical strategies blocking ovarian steroidogenesis and local estrogen synthesis by the aromatase enzyme represent an indispensable option for treatment (10) .However, the majority of patients require hysterectomy (11, 12) , which is a radical treatment but not an appropriate option for women who desire pregnancy. Adenomyosis once was seen as a disease of parous women that could be diagnosed only by surgical resection and pathological examination (13) .However, advancements in high-resolution imaging now allow for noninvasive diagnosis by magnetic resonance imaging or transvaginal ultrasound (14, 15) .Ultrasound features of the adenomyotic uterus include an enlarged uterus, asymmetry of the myometrial thickness, a poorly defined endomyometrial junction, and heterogeneously hypoechoic myometrium (11) .Development of noninvasive diagnostic techniques also revealed a higher prevalence of adenomyosis in infertile women (16, 17) ; suggested mechanisms underlying uterine factor infertility include abnormal decidualization resulting in impaired endometrial receptivity, altered peristalsis of the uterus, and disruption of the endomyometrial junction (18, 19) .Alterations in the immune system linked to sex steroid hormone changes and epithelial mesenchymal transition in women with adenomyosis may promote inflammation and impair fertility (20) .Some studies have shown that adenomyosis is associated not only with infertility but also increased risk of miscarriage (21, 22) . Recent research has led to new insights into the molecular pathophysiology of adenomyosis.Evidence from nextgeneration screening-based studies identified KRAS mutations in endometrial epithelial cell clones and adjacent adenomyotic tissue (5, 23) .These activating KRAS mutations, which also have been found in endometriosis, are one of the most frequent driver mutations in malignancies, such as lung, pancreatic, and colorectal cancers (24) .KRAS mutations in adenomyosis and endometriosis are confined to endometrial epithelial cells and associated with specific pathways that increase cell survival and proliferation (25) .These mutations also have been associated with progesterone resistance in adenomyosis (23) .The findings of next-generation screening-based studies favor mechanisms involving invagination of mutated cells rather than metaplasia or differentiation of progenitor cells; however, more work is needed to understand gene expression in the extremely heterogeneous adenomyotic cell populations and cross talk with surrounding tissues. The histologically complex nature of adenomyosis, with island-like structures inside the myometrium that also contain endometrial and myometrial cells, makes it difficult to identify pathophysiologic mechanisms based on the average gene expression of the whole tissue because of the background noise or dilution issues.Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has opened a new era in research that enables investigators to reveal the heterogeneity in complex tissues and understand how distinct cell types contribute to disease (26) .In a recent study, scRNA-seq of endometrial tissues collected throughout the menstrual cycle from healthy women revealed 7 cell types based on the transcriptomic profile of epithelial cells and stromal fibroblasts during 4 major phases of endometrial transformation (27) .Here, we applied scRNA-seq to analyze the cellular composition and transcriptomic profiles of matched tissues of endometrium, normal myometrium, and adenomyosis from the same hysterectomy specimens collected from 3 women, with the goal of identifying specific signaling pathways and cell-cell interactions in the adenomyotic uterus that contribute to this complex disease. Northwestern University\\'s institutional review board approved the use of human tissue for this study.After obtaining written informed consent, adenomyotic tissue and adjacent normal endometrium and normal myometrium were obtained from premenopausal women undergoing hysterectomy for adenomyosis.Three samples were collected from each patient, for a total of 9 samples from 3 patients.Briefly, after hysterectomy, 3 samples from each hysterectomy specimen were dissected by a senior pathologist immediately and confirmed histologically using hematoxylin and eosin staining.Normal-appearing endometrial and myometrial samples were obtained at 1 cm from adenomyotic tissue.For normalappearing endometrium we obtained a full thickness section of endometrial tissue that included functionalis and basalis layers.After tissue dissection and digestion as described below, single-cell suspensions were submitted for scRNAseq in the Northwestern University NUSeq Core (Fig. 1A ).The age range of the patients was 40-44 years and each patient had at least 1 previous delivery.No patient had been receiving hormonal treatment at the time of tissue collection for a period of at least 3 months preoperatively.All tissues were collected during the follicular phase.The cycle phase was determined based on last menstrual period and histology.All 3 patients had diagnoses of diffuse adenomyosis confirmed by pathology reports. Adenomyotic, endometrial, and myometrial tissues were dissociated and cells were isolated using a previously described protocol (28) .Briefly, tissues were digested or frozen within 12 hours after hysterectomy.Samples from 2 patients (6 samples) were processed fresh.The remaining patient\\'s samples (3 samples) were frozen due to lack of available appointments in the Northwestern University NUSeq Core.For the fresh samples, tissues were kept in HypoThermosol FRS Solution (BioLife Solutions, Bothell, WA) for up to 12 hours.Tissues were minced into very small pieces in a petri dish with Hank\\'s balanced salt solution, then placed in a 50 mL Falcon tube with digestion enzyme mixture (collagenase, protease, DNase, hyaluronidase, and calcium chloride) in 10 mL Hank\\'s balanced salt solution.Tissues were incubated for 2 hours in a 37 C bead bad incubator with 5 minutes of gentle shaking every 30 minutes.After enzymatic and mechanical digestion, the tissue fraction was allowed to sediment out (approximately 2-5 minutes).The stromal cells and smooth muscle cells were collected by passing the digested supernatant through 70-mm cell sieves and debris was left in the filter.Red blood cell lysis was performed for the stromal cell fraction.For adenomyotic and endometrial tissues, the epithelial cell pellets were backwashed by inverting the cell strainer and centrifugation.The supernatant was removed, and epithelial cells were digested further with 1 mL TrypLE express enzyme (Gibco, Billings, MNT) at 37 C for 10 minutes, followed by passing through 70-mm cell sieves to obtain single epithelial cell suspensions.Epithelial and stroma cell suspensions were centrifuged at 300 relative centrifugal force for 5 minutes at room temperature.After removing the supernatant without disrupting the pellet, stromal and epithelial cells were suspended and mixed together in Â1 phosphate-buffered saline with 0.04% bovine serum albumin (400 mg/mL) to achieve the target cell concentration (<5 million cells per tube in 1 mL washing solution in 2 mL DNA LoBind Tubes).Epithelial cell digestion steps were skipped for normal myometrium tissue because significant numbers of epithelial cells were expected in the sample.For all 3 tissue types, to remove the remaining cell debris and large clumps, the cell suspension was pipetted gently and filtered with Scienceware 40 mm Flowm Tip strainers (VWR, Radnor, PA).For frozen samples, the tissue was minced into very small pieces immediately after collection from the pathology core and split into cryovials containing Cryostor CS10 Freeze media (BioLife Solutions).Before scRNA-seq, frozen samples were thawed in a 37 C bath for 1 minute and digested to obtain single-cell suspensions, as described above. Single-cell suspensions of each tissue in DNA LoBind tubes were placed on ice and submitted to the NUSeq Core immediately to check the viability and cell number.Cell yield and viability of the frozen and thawed samples and fresh samples were comparable and >75%, as determined by the trypan blue cell viability assay.From the 9 samples, a total of approximately 90,000 cells were collected.After checking for sample quality and filtering out dead cells, the final total cell number was 66,000.Overall, the contribution from each of the 3 patients to cell clusters was comparable in terms of total cell numbers.However, we noted that each patient sample contributed variably to 3 cell clusters in endometrial and adenomyotic issues.The contribution came primarily from a single patient in 3 extremely small clusters: 2 endometrial clusters (progenitor and T-cell) and 1 adenomyotic cluster (neuron-like).Data from these 3 clusters were excluded from our analyses.Due to high cell yield, suspensions were diluted before sequencing to obtain the target cell concentration.Single-cell suspensions from adenomyotic uteri with approximately 80% cell viability was used as input material with an optimal cell concentration of 700-1200 cells/mL.Samples then were processed for construction of 10Â libraries for sequencing using the 10Â Genomics Single-Cell 3 0 reagent kit protocol.Samples were loaded onto the 10Â Genomics Chromium platform to generate single-cell gel beads in emulsion.Cells underwent reverse transcription reactions to generate barcoded cDNA, which shares a 10Â barcode with all cDNA from its individual cell of origin.Subsequently, the gel beads in emulsion were broken, and all uniquely barcoded cDNAs were pooled and amplified by polymerase chain reaction to generate material for sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 at a depth of average 37,000 reads per cell. Pre-processing and integration.Processed data from the Cell Ranger pipeline was analyzed using the R package Seurat (v3.2) as described previously (29) .Quality control analysis was performed before data integration.Cells with %300 gene counts and cells with >15% mitochondrial RNA content were filtered out to remove low-quality cells.After log normalization of the filtered data from the 3 patients, data were aligned using the FindIntegrationAnchors and Integra-teData functions to remove batch effects.This process was performed for data from adenomyosis, endometrium, and myometrium samples separately to identify and compare tissue-specific cell types. Cell clustering, visualization, and cell-type annotation.After scaling with a coefficient and regressing out the effects of mitochondrial genes and the cell cycle effect (S Scores and iG2 Scores), principal component analysis was performed with 30 principal components and a default resolution parameter using the FindCluster function.Identified cell clusters were visualized by a nonlinear dimensionality reduction algorithm, UMAP.To identify the cell type of each cluster, canonical cell marker gene information was collected from the published Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of adenomyosis tissue.(A) UMAP presentation of adenomyotic cell clusters.There is a larger and more heterogeneous group of fibroblast-like cells than endometrial fibroblasts (see Fig. 1 ).In contrast to endometrial tissue, there is no readily recognizable connection between the pericyte progenitors and fibroblast-like cells.(B) Fibroblasts comprised a much larger portion (50%) of adenomyosis, compared with endometrial fibroblast population (36%, see Fig. 1 ).In contrast, epithelial cells made up only 3% of adenomyosis versus 14% of endometrial tissue (see Fig. literature, then marker genes for every cluster were identified using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test option of the FindAll-Markers function, and clusters were annotated based on the presence of reference marker genes in these clusters. Pseudotime, DoRothEA, PROGENy, and gene enrichment analyses.After transferring Seurat-generated cluster embeddings into a monocle object, pseudotime analysis was performed on the fibroblast-like cell clusters using monocle3 (v0.2.1) (30) .Transcription factor (TF) enrichment analysis was performed on fibroblast-like cell clusters of all tissues using the discriminant regulon expression analysis tool, DoRo-thEA (v2), which is a curated resource of TFs and their transcriptional targets (31) .First, regulons with A-C confidence level were selected for the analysis, then the 20 most variable TFs in selected clusters were visualized.Pathway activities of selected clusters were estimated by PROGENy, which infers pathway activity from perturbation experiments (32) .Gene ontology terms for differentially upregulated genes in unciliated epithelial cells in adenomyosis and endometrium samples were identified using cluster Profiler on Gene Set Enrichment Analysis using the gseGO function for all ontologies.Normalized enrichment scores were calculated for enrichment after correcting for multiple testing with the Benjamini-Hochberg method.Dot plots were generated to show significant GO terms based on their p-adjusted value and Gene Ratio, derived by dividing the total number of genes in the gene set by the number of overlapping genes.In these pathway analyses, we excluded the clusters that originated primarily from the tissue of from a single patient; i.e., E18 and E21 from endometrium and A24 from adenomyosis (see Figs. 1E, 2C ). We identified 21 cell clusters comprised of 12 distinct cell types shown in the UMAP: unciliated (3 clusters) and ciliated epithelial cells, endothelial cells (3 clusters), fibroblast-like cells (4 clusters), activated fibroblasts, pericytes, vascular smooth muscle cells, NK cells, T cells (3 clusters), B cells, macrophages, monocytes, and potential progenitor cells (Fig. 1B ) The top markers for each cell type are shown in a dot blot (Fig. 1C ), and the top markers for each cluster are shown in a detailed heatmap (Supplemental Fig. 1a ). Unciliated epithelial cells organized in 3 clusters (E2, E17, E19) comprised 11% of the endometrium.Epithelial cells were identified with canonical markers including EPCAM, PAEP, MMP7, and KRT18.We also identified one ciliated epithelial cell cluster, which expresses cilia-associated genes (C14), such as RSPH1, AGR3, and PIFO; this cell type was described recently in a study performing scRNA-seq of normal endometrium (27; Figs. 1B-D ). Endothelial cells expressed PECAM1, SOX18 and CLDN5 and were present in 3 clusters (E3, E9, E16), which constituted 14% of endometrium (Figs. 1B-D ). Immune cells constituted of 24% of endometrium.The dominant immune cells were NK cells (7%) expressing NKG7 and GNLY) and T cells (12%) expressing CD3D and CD69.Macrophages and monocytes were identified based on CD74 and HLA-DRA expression.A very small B cell cluster also was present (1%), which expressed CD79A and IGKC (Figs. 1B-D ). Fibroblast-like cells constituted the majority of the endometrium (36%).We identified 4 closely grouped clusters of fibroblast-like cells (E0, E1, E11, E13), which express collagen and matrix-related genes (Figs. 1B-D ).When comparing endometrial tissues across the 3 patients, all 3 tissues contained the majority of cellular clusters, although at varying levels (Fig. 1E ). Fibroblast clusters E0 and E1 had similar gene expression profiles, with both expressing SFRP4, COL1A1, LUM, MMP11, SFRP1, ECM1, and IGF1 (Fig. 1F ).Feature plots also revealed that both clusters also expressed MME, ESR1, and PGR, which are expressed by endometrial stromal fibroblasts (Fig. 1G ).Cluster E11 showed high expression of adhesion-related genes, such as WISP2, CCDC80, GSN, OGN, and SERPINF1.Cluster E13 was slightly segregated from the group and uniquely expressed differentiation and mitogenesis-related genes, such as FOSB, EGR1, NR4A1, FOS, RO RB, THBS1, ESR1, JUN, and PDGFRA.Among all fibroblast-like cells, ESR1 expression was the highest in cluster E13, which we identified as differentiated fibroblasts.Some of the key genes expressed in the fibroblast-like populations are shown as feature plots in Figures 1F and 1G . A distinct cluster (E7) that closely mapped to fibroblasts showed unique expression of the pericyte markers COX4I2, MCAM, NOTCH3, and PDGFRB.Attached to E7 was a vascular smooth muscle cell cluster (E6) expressing markers, such as MYL9, TINAGL, BCAM, MYH11, MYLK, and ACTA2 (Fig. 1F ).Because stem/progenitor type cells were detected consistently among pericytes, we performed a pseudotime analysis starting from cluster E7 (33) .Intriguingly, the differentiation trajectory initiating from pericytes progressed through fibroblast-like cells in E0 and E1, then through actively differentiating fibroblast-like cells (E13) and ended in ciliated epithelium (E14; Fig. 1H ).Endometrial mesenchymal stem cells were reported previously to be clonogenic and multipotent pericytes, which may respond to conditions during endometrial regeneration (34) .Therefore, our findings suggest that fibroblast-like cells might originate from pericytes with mesenchymal stem cell characteristics.The scRNA-seq data also suggested that ciliated epithelial cells may be derived from pericytes through mesenchymalepithelial transition (MET; Fig. 1H ).The PROGENy analysis of this MET trajectory showed that 2 distinct signaling pathways, namely PI3K and P53, were upregulated in differentiated fibroblast-like cells (E13) and the ciliated epithelial cluster (E14), respectively (Fig. 1I ).We also used DoRothEA to examine differential expression of TFs in MET differentiation trajectories (E7/E0/E1/E11/E14), which is detailed in Supplemental Fig. 1b (available online). We identified 24 clusters including 13 cell types in adenomyotic tissue, as shown in UMAP (Fig. 2A ).Compared with endometrium, adenomyotic tissue had a higher proportion of fibroblasts and lower proportion of epithelial cells.Fibroblastlike cells constituted 50% of the tissue and showed a high degree of heterogeneity, gathering in 6 distinct clusters (A0, A1, A4, A5, A6, A12).A smooth muscle cell cluster (A2), which closely grouped with the fibroblast populations, constituted 9% of adenomyotic tissue.Epithelial cells constituted 3% of the tissue including ciliated and unciliated epithelium (A13, A18; Figs. 2A, 2B ).Unlike endometrium, we identified a small neuron-like cluster (A24) grouped with fibroblast-like cells and a cluster with myeloid progenitor cells grouped with mast cells (A23).The relative contributions of each cluster per patient and the top gene markers for each cell type are shown in Figures 2C and 2D and Supplemental Figure 2a (available online).Immune cells constituted 13% of adenomyosis, compared with 24% in endometrium.Macrophages and monocytes constituted 6% of cells in adenomyotic tissue followed by T cells (5%) and NK cells (2%).Endothelial cells constituted approximately 15% of the tissue (A3, A10, A14), with a small cluster including lymphatic endothelial cells (A17).In contrast with endometrium, pericytes (A8) and vascular smooth muscle cells (A9) clustered separately from the fibroblast-like cells.Similar to the endometrium, we identified a potential progenitor cell cluster (A19), which associated closely with fibroblast-like cells and constituted 1% of adenomyotic tissue (Figs. 2A, 2B ). The fibroblast-like clusters A0, A6, A5, A1 and A12 showed transcriptomic similarities and represented a group distinct from A2, which was uniquely enriched in smooth muscle cell markers, and A4 that had a strong signature for extracellular matrix-related genes (Fig. 2E ).In A0, a TF analysis demonstrated increased activity of ESR2, ETS2, FLI1, and FOXL2 (Supplemental Fig. 2b ), whereas PROGENy showed activation of the MAPK and EGFR pathways, both of which are associated with cell proliferation (Fig. 2H ).The neighboring A6 cluster had high expression of PDGFRA, COL6A3, MME, ESR1, RORB and HAND2, classical markers for mesenchymal progenitors as well as endometrial stromal cells (Fig. 2E ).The PDGFRA together with ESR1 genes were expressed in A6, suggestive of actively proliferating and differentiating mesenchymal cells driven by estrogen.Interestingly, A6 showed a pattern of maximum ESR1 expression indicative of high estrogen responsiveness, whereas the highest PGR expression was seen in A12 and A5 (Fig. 2F ).This pattern of progression of ESR1/PGR expression is consistent with a pseudotime analysis showing differentiation in the direction of A0/A6/A12/A5 (Figs. 2F, 2G ).The TF analysis suggested that A6 and A12 have increased ATF3 activity, which is related to cellular response to injury, and A6 showed MXI1 and THAP11 upregulation, which are related with pluripotency and mesenchymal cell differentiation (Supplemental Fig. 2b ). Cluster A2 showed clear expression of smooth muscle cell markers, such as ACTA2, DES, ACTG2, and MYLK; therefore, we identified it as the smooth muscle cells (SMCs) cluster (Fig. 2E ).Pseudotime analysis suggested that this SMC cluster seems to originate from an adenomyotic fibroblast cluster after a differentiation pattern of A0/A6/A12/A5/A2 (Fig. 2G ).The TF analysis of A2 showed high activity of MEF2A, TEAD1, and SMAD4, which are associated with EMT regulation and muscle hypertrophy.Matrix gla protein (MGP) was the top marker in A4; these cells showed high expression of genes associated with matrix remodeling including decorin (DCN), which is a collagen binding proteoglycan of extracellular matrix, asporin (ASPN), which has a key role in osteoblast driven collagen mineralization activity, and other genes related to macrophage response, such as AEBP1.The TFs associated with immune response (STAT3, SPI) and muscle hypertrophy (SMAD4), and the related TNF and NFKB pathways, were predicted to be activated in this cluster (Supplemental Fig. 2b ).The MGP-expressing A4 cluster may represent terminally differentiated fibroblasts that are resident in adenomyosis. In the fibroblast-like cell population, the pseudotime analysis initiated from A0 showed a pro-proliferative transcriptomic profile similar to that of the small progenitor cluster (A19, Fig. 2E ); the differentiation trajectory diffusely transitioned via A1, A6, A12, and A5, and segregated to reach 2 clear end points, namely A2 (SMCs) and A4 (fibroblast-like cells expressing matrix-associated genes including MGP, thus designated MGP fibroblast-like; Fig. 2G ).Intriguingly, this analysis also demonstrated a trajectory between the small progenitor cluster (A19) and the entire congregated fibroblast-like population (Fig. 2G ).A19 expressed mitosis and cell division-associated genes and was closely related transcriptomically to the progenitor cluster E18 in endometrium.Fibroblast-like cells were clustered tightly in adenomyosis, and unlike endometrial tissue, pericytes (A8) and vascular SMCs (A9) were not linked directly to this fibroblast-like population (Figs. 1B, 2A ).A pseudotime analysis starting from pericytes did not show a continuation to fibroblast-like cells in adenomyotic tissue. Overall, there were 20 clusters including 10 cell types in myometrium (Supplemental Fig. 3a , available online).As in endometrium and adenomyosis, the dominant cell type in myometrium comprised 5 closely bundled fibroblast-like cell clusters (40%), followed by SMCs (18%; Supplemental Fig. 3b ).Intriguingly, there were 2 small clusters of epithelial cells (<1%) in myometrium (M17, M20) and 4 clusters of endothelial cells (M2, M12, M14) including a lymphatic endothelial cell cluster (M13).Similar to endometrium and adenomyosis, pericytes (M7) and vascular SMCs (M8, M9) clustered together.T cells made up the dominant immune cell cluster, similar to endometrium, followed by macrophages and monocytes.Relative contributions of clusters by each patient are shown in (Supplemental Fig. 3c ). The fibroblast-like cells in myometrial tissue were comprised of a close group of 5 clusters (M0, M1, M4, M11, M16).We performed subcluster analysis on these groups, as demonstrated in a heatmap (Supplemental Fig. 3d ).The OGN, CTGF, CYR61, and LUM genes were the top markers in M0; these genes are associated with collagen formation and remodeling (35) (36) (37) .Cluster M0 showed similarity to M11, which uniquely expressed MGP and was designated a \\'\\'MGP fibroblast-like\\'\\' cluster, similar to A4 (Fig. 2E ).Cluster M11 also showed high expression of matrix-associated proteins, such as gelsolin (GSN), decorin (DCN), and fibulin-1 (FBLN1) (38) . Fibroblast clusters M1 and M4 had high expression of MMP11, SFRP4, CRABP2, and VCAN; however, unlike M1, M4 also showed upregulation of WNT2, ECM1, and COL3A1 as well as retinoic acid metabolism-associated genes, such as ALDH1A2, RORB, and RBP1 (39).The MDK gene, another highly expressed gene in M4, encodes a protein that responds to retinoic acid and promotes cell survival, migration, and tumorigenesis (40) .Cluster M16 was distinct from all other clusters and showed a unique gene expression profile of differentiation and early response genes, such as FOS, JUN, and EGR1 (41) .The PROGENy analysis showed upregulation of hypoxia, TGFB, P53, NFkB, TNF, and JAK-STAT pathways in M11 (MGP fibroblast-like cells), similar to A4 in adenomyosis (Supplemental Fig. 3e and Fig. 2H ).A pseudotime analysis originating from the myometrial fibroblast cluster M4 showed a differentiation map through M1 and M0 that ended in M11 (MGP fibroblast-like cells; Supplemental Fig. 3f ), similar to adenomyosis fibroblasts (Fig. 2G ).Cluster-specific markers and a list of regulatory TFs in fibroblast-like cell clusters in myometrium are shown in a detailed heatmap (Supplemental Figs. 4a, 4b , available online). We also interrogated the similarities and the differences between the 2 SMC clusters M3 and M5 and the SMC cluster (A2) in adenomyosis (Supplemental Fig. 4c ).The transcriptomic profiles of M3 and A2 are quite similar with high expression of SFRP4, a modulator of the WNT pathway (Supplemental Fig. 4c ).These data collectively suggest that in myometrial and adenomyotic tissues, SMCs likely originate from a fibroblast-like cluster. We next evaluated differential gene expression patterns in fibroblast clusters that distinguish adenomyosis from endometrium and myometrium (Figs. 3A, 3B ).Among the fibroblast-like clusters in adenomyosis and endometrium, the most striking observation was that A0 is very similar to E0 and E1 endometrial fibroblasts (Fig. 3A ).This suggested that A0 fibroblasts represent a population that migrated from endometrium to invade myometrial tissue and contributed to adenomyosis (see Figs. 1B, 2A ).Pseudotime analyses suggested that A0, E0, and E1 all have progenitor-like features, from which more differentiated fibroblasts originate (see Figs. 1H, 2G ). When adenomyotic and myometrial fibroblast clusters were compared (Fig. 3B ), A4 showed striking similarities to M0 and M11, all of which expressed the highest levels of MGP and seemed to represent a terminally differentiated population among the fibroblast-like clusters in each tissue (see Fig. 2G and Supplemental Fig. 3f ).The MGP is a structural extracellular matrix constituent (42) , and our finding resonates with the observed increase in extracellular matrix in adenomyotic tissue. Intriguingly, the gene family SFRP, which are modulators of the WNT pathway, were expressed prominently in fibroblast-like clusters, showing cross-tissue similarities between the endometrium, adenomyosis, and myometrium (Figs. 3A, 3B ).Therefore, we first determined the differential expression of the members of this gene family across the 3 tissues (Fig. 3C ).Both SFRP1 and SFRP4 levels were higher in adenomyosis than in endometrium or myometrium (Fig. 3C ).Gene SFRP2 was expressed only in adenomyosis and myometrium (A4, M11; Figs. 3A-C ).It has been reported that SFRP2, which is a WNT antagonist, downregulates estrogen-dependent b-catenin activity, inhibits cell growth, and promotes myogenesis (43) .The lack of SFRP2 expression in endometrium might permit epithelial cell growth and invasiveness.Thus, SFRP2 might be a key predictive marker of epithelial cell growth potential in adenomyosis.Interestingly, SFRP1 and SFRP4 are expressed in all fibroblast-like clusters in adenomyosis, whereas SFRP2 is expressed only in A4 (Fig. 3D ). The cells in clusters A1, A5, A6, and A12 seemed to be distinct within adenomyotic tissue (Figs. 3A, 3B ); analysis of adenomyotic fibroblast-like cells showed uniquely upregulated genes involved in the WNT pathway, ribosome biogenesis, and protein targeting to endoplasmic reticulum (Supplemental Fig. 5 , available online).Expression of genes in the ribosome biogenesis pathway was strikingly prominent in A12.Ribosome biogenesis is an established pathway that supports tumor cell growth and proliferation (44) . The epithelium represents the defining cell type in adenomyosis, and adenomyosis is thought to originate from the endometrium.Therefore, we further analyzed differentially expressed genes in epithelial cells between matched adenomyotic tissue and endometrium (5) .First, we used scatter plot analysis to define the ciliated and unciliated epithelial cells in our tissues (Fig. 4A ).As expected, classical markers, such as PAEP and MMP7, were conspicuously higher in unciliated epithelial cells, whereas a much larger number of genes were prominently expressed in ciliated epithelial cells (Fig. 4A ) (27) .Then, we identified differentially expressed genes separately in unciliated and ciliated epithelia in adenomyosis and endometrium (Figs. 4B, 4C ).In general, unciliated and ciliated epithelium in adenomyotic tissue and endometrium showed similar transcriptomic profiles.In unciliated epithelium, however, expression of a number of genes was significantly higher in endometrium, including markers of differentiation, such as PAEP, PLCG2, HSPA1A, and HSP90AA1 (Fig. 4B ).The PAEP marker, also known as glycodelin, is a secretory glycoprotein that is regulated by progesterone and associated with differentiation and healthy implantation (45, 46) .This finding may suggest the presence of progesterone resistance in adenomyotic unciliated epithelium (39, 47) .In unciliated and ciliated epithelial cells, expression of heat shock proteins (HSPA1A, HSP90AA1) was significantly lower in adenomyosis than in endometrium (Figs. 4B, 4C ).Because some heat shock proteins are important for estrogen action, which seems to have a role in adenomyosis (5) , this finding requires further investigation. We also noted that immune function-related genes and pathways are upregulated in unciliated epithelial cells of adenomyosis compared with endometrium (Figs. 4B, 4D ).Expression of genes associated with immune response and macrophage activation, such as HLA-DRA, HLA-DRB1, CD74, NFKBIA, and S100A6, were significantly higher in adenomyotic epithelium (Fig. 4B ).These genes also are related to cell proliferation, inflammation, and cell motility.Among the upregulated pathways in adenomyosis, immune response-related processes were significantly upregulated in adenomyosis in ciliated and unciliated epithelium (Fig. 4D ).Moreover, genes involved in the canonical WNT signaling pathway and regulation of epithelial cell migration pathways were upregulated only in adenomyotic unciliated epithelium. In our analysis, WNT signaling emerged as a prominent biological process that was differentially regulated in stromal, epithelial, and SMCs; thus, we performed bioinformatics to further analyze paracrine and intracrine WNT-related interactions between all cell types in adenomyotic tissue (cellcell communication analysis, Fig. 4E ) The WNT signaling network analysis identified multiple signals originating from fibroblast clusters A0, A1, A5, and A12 toward epithelial and endothelial clusters A10, A13, A14, and A18 (Fig. 4E ).The directionality of signals from stromal cells toward endothelial and epithelial cells is supported by the distribution of expression of ligands (WNT) and their receptors (FZD and LRP) in each cluster (Fig. 4F ).In particular, WNT2 and WNT4 were expressed prominently in adenomyosis-specific fibroblastlike clusters, such as A0, A1, A5, and A12 (Fig. 4F ; see Fig. 3 ).The most prominent WNT receptors expressed in endothelial or epithelial cells were FZD6 and LRP6.In summary, our scRNA-seq analysis uncovered significant roles of various fibroblast populations in endometrium and adenomyosis that seem to have central roles in adenomyosis pathophysiology via WNT signaling to endothelial and epithelial cells. To our knowledge, this is the first detailed characterization of the transcriptomic landscape of the adenomyotic uterus using scRNA-seq to compare gene expression in distinct cell types of matched endometrium, adenomyotic tissue, and myometrium.We identified ciliated and unciliated epithelial cells, fibroblast-like cells, SMCs, endothelial cells, pericytes, vascular SMCs, potential progenitor cells, T cells, NK cells, B cells, macrophages, and monocytes, as well as small clusters including neurons and myeloid progenitors in the adenomyotic uterus.Our analyses revealed a high degree of heterogeneity in fibroblast-like cells in the adenomyotic uterus.This heterogeneity may be due to different transcriptional states driven by inflammation and fibrosis in adenomyosis.We identified fibroblast-like cell clusters that we suspect represent a disease-specific transcriptome (A1, A5, A6, and A12; Figs. 3A, 3B ). The pathophysiology of adenomyosis has been debated; however, current evidence suggests that adenomyosis occurs after the invasion of the myometrium by cellular oligoclones comprised of deep glandular epithelial cells with KRAS mutations together with attached endometrial stromal cells (5, 23) .The lack of a substantial difference between epithelial cells in adenomyotic tissue and endometrium in our study supports this theory.Progesterone resistance has been demonstrated in adenomyotic tissue; Inuoe et al. (23) linked progesterone resistance to autonomously activated KRAS.Overall progesterone receptor (PGR) levels have been reported to be lower in adenomyosis compared to normal endometrium (48) ; however, we here identified higher PGR expression in distinct populations of fibroblast-like cells in adenomyotic tissue than in endometrium and myometrium, suggesting that progesterone resistance at the level of stromal cells is mediated by complex cellular and molecular mechanisms (Supplemental Fig. 6 , available online).On the other hand, epithelial cells in adenomyotic tissue showed downregulation of PAEP compared with epithelial cells in endometrium; PAEP is an important progesterone-responsive gene (45, 46) .This is suggestive that progesterone action in the context of a stromal-epithelial paracrine interaction may be deficient in adenomyosis (5, 39) . The first study comparing eutopic endometrial tissues of women with or without adenomyosis identified differentially expressed genes, which might initiate the disease pathways including eukaryotic initiation factor 2 signaling, oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and estrogen receptor signaling (49) .This study was based on microarray analysis and suggested that these abnormalities might be associated with the invasion of myometrial tissue by endometrial cells (49) .A more recent study used bulk RNA sequencing to identify differentially expressed genes and molecular pathways in the eutopic endometrium from adenomyosis patients (50) .These investigators found that IL-6 and ERK/MAPKrelated pathways were activated in the eutopic endometrium of adenomyotic uterine tissues (50) .A different study also identified the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway in association with the proliferation of uterine SMCs in women with adenomyosis (51) . The WNT pathway has been studied in the pathophysiology of adenomyosis (52); however, cell-specific details of its role have not been well understood.Here, we identified an intricate WNT signaling network between fibroblast-like cells and epithelial and endothelial cells in adenomyosis (Fig. 4E ).Differentially expressed gene analysis in fibroblast-like cells from different tissues showed significant differences in expression of SFRP family members, which modulate WNT signaling (Figs. 3A, 3B ).The SFRPs antagonize WNT signaling by competing with WNT proteins for receptor binding (53) .We found that SFRPs are upregulated in fibroblast-like cells of adenomyosis compared with endometrium and normal-appearing myometrium, and that fibroblast-like cells in adenomyotic tissue express significantly higher SFRP1 and SFRP4.Moreover, the WNT pathway is regulated at another level with increased signaling from fibroblast-like cells to epithelial cells (Figs. 4E, 4F ).This is suggestive that WNT activity may be upregulated in epithelial cells and downregulated via SFRPs in fibroblasts in adenomyotic tissue. Another recent study compared endometrial and myometrial tissues of women with or without diffuse adenomyosis at the transcriptomic level (54) .These investigators found that biological processes, including inflammation, extracellular matrix organization, collagen degradation, hyaluronan synthesis, and cell migration, were upregulated in adenomyosis.In the myometrial compartment, top biological processes in women with adenomyosis were extracellular matrix dysfunction, abnormal sensory pain perception, and g-aminobutyric acid synaptic transmission (54) .We also identified a unique cluster in adenomyosis (A4) that has a strong signature for extracellular matrix-related genes (Fig. 2E ). There are some limitations to our study.Despite being a powerful approach to establishing the transcriptomic profile of individual cells in heterogenous cell populations, singlecell sequencing has drawbacks (26) .Single-cell sequencing technology allows assessment of heterogeneity in complex tissues, but low coverage prevents detection of mutations (42) .Thus, a major limitation of our study is a lack of mutation information.Additionally, we did not identify cell surface markers and, thus, could not sort cells to verify the identities or functions of the cell clusters.Because adenomyosis is a disease that develops within the myometrium, we originally expected to see a higher number of SMCs but found a higher complement of fibroblasts compared with SMCs.A potential explanation is that fibroblast-like cells were more easily digested than SMCs, and thus a higher number of fibroblast-like cells than SMCs were prepared and analyzed.Our findings, on the other hand, also may reflect the in vivo nature of myometrial tissue.In fact, a recent scRNA-seq analysis of the myometrium identified fibroblasts as a major component of this tissue (55) .Nevertheless, the comparative transcriptomic analysis of matched endometrium, adjacent myometrium, and adenomyotic tissue within the same uteri obtained from 3 patients via scRNA-seq is a significant strength of our study.The only other study using scRNA-seq to evaluate adenomyosis used a single patient and did not provide any comparative information regarding normal-appearing myometrium of the adenomyotic uterus (56) . In conclusion, adenomyosis is a complex pathology associated with elaborate molecular mechanisms characterized by estrogen-dependent chronic inflammation, progesterone resistance, and epithelial KRAS mutations (23) .Recent DNA-based evidence provided irrefutable support that adenomyotic lesions originate from adjacent endometrial tissue; thus, the theory of entrapped endometrium as the origin of adenomyosis pertains (23) .Here, we used a cutting-edge procedure to define gene expression profiles of the individual cell types in adenomyotic tissue and adjacent endometrium and myometrium in an attempt to ascertain the cell-cell interactions and the key signaling pathways involved in the pathophysiology of adenomyosis.The WNT pathway turned out to be a candidate regulator of the critical biological processes in adenomyosis.We anticipate that our findings may facilitate the identification of new therapeutic targets for adenomyosis.

To assess the e ect of routine pregnancy ultrasound before 24 weeks as part of a screening programme, compared to selective ultrasound or no ultrasound, on the early diagnosis of abnormal pregnancy location, termination for fetal congenital abnormality, multiple pregnancy, maternal outcomes and later fetal compromise. To assess the e ect of first trimester (before 14 weeks) and second trimester (14 to 24 weeks) ultrasound, separately. We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth\\'s Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov,and the World Health Organization\\'s International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) on 11 August 2020.We also examined the reference lists of retrieved studies. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, cluster-RCTs and RCTs published in abstract form.We included all trials with pregnant women who had routine or revealed ultrasound versus selective ultrasound, no ultrasound, or concealed ultrasound, before 24 weeks\\' gestation.All eligible studies were screened for scientific integrity and trustworthiness. Two review authors independently assessed trials for eligibility and risk of bias, extracted data and checked extracted data for accuracy.Two review authors independently used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome Our review included data from 13 RCTs including 85,265 women.The review included four comparisons.Four trials were assessed to be at low risk of bias for both sequence generation and allocation concealment and two as high risk.The nature of the intervention made it impossible to blind women and sta providing care to treatment allocation.Sample attrition was low in the majority of trials and outcome data were available for most women.Many trials were conducted before it was customary for trials to be registered and protocols published. First trimester routine versus selective ultrasound: four studies, 1791 women, from Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US). First trimester scans probably reduce short-term maternal anxiety about pregnancy (risk ratio (RR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65 to 0.99; moderate-certainty evidence).We do not have information on whether the reduction was sustained. The evidence is very uncertain about the e ect of first trimester scans on perinatal loss (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.73 ; 648 participants; one study; low-certainty evidence) or induction of labour for post-maturity (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.37; 1474 participants; three studies; lowcertainty evidence). The e ect of routine first trimester ultrasound on birth before 34 weeks or termination of pregnancy for fetal abnormality was not reported. Second trimester routine versus selective ultrasound: seven studies, 36,053 women, from Finland, Norway, South Africa, Sweden and the US. Second trimester scans probably make little di erence to perinatal loss (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.20; 17,918 participants, three studies; moderate-certainty evidence) or intrauterine fetal death (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.42; 29,584 participants, three studies; low-certainty evidence). Second trimester scans may reduce induction of labour for post-maturity (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.73; 24,174 participants, six studies; lowcertainty evidence), presumably by more accurate dating. Routine second trimester ultrasound may improve detection of multiple pregnancy (RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.16; 274 participants, five studies; low-certainty evidence). Routine second trimester ultrasound may increase detection of major fetal abnormality before 24 weeks (RR 3.45, 95% CI 1.67 to 7.12; 387 participants, two studies; low-certainty evidence) and probably increases the number of women terminating pregnancy for major anomaly (RR 2.36, 95% CI 1.13 to 4.93; 26, 893 participants, four studies; moderate-certainty evidence). Long-term follow-up of children exposed to scans before birth did not indicate harm to children\\'s physical or intellectual development (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.34 ; 603 participants, one study; low-certainty evidence). The e ect of routine second trimester ultrasound on birth before 34 weeks or maternal anxiety was not reported. Standard care plus two ultrasounds and referral for complications versus standard care: one cluster-RCT, 47,431 women, from Democratic Republic of Congo, Guatemala, Kenya, Pakistan and Zambia. This trial included a co-intervention, training of healthcare workers and referral for complications and was, therefore, assessed separately. Standard pregnancy care plus two scans, and training and referral for complications, versus standard care probably makes little di erence to whether women with complications give birth in a risk appropriate setting with facilities for caesarean section (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.19; 11,680 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) .The intervention also probably makes little to no di erence to low birthweight (< 2500 g) (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.13; 47,312 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).The evidence is very uncertain about whether the community intervention (including ultrasound) makes any di erence to maternal mortality (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.55; 46,768 participants; low-certainty evidence) . Revealed ultrasound results (communicated to both patient and doctor) versus concealed ultrasound results (blinded to both patient and doctor at any time before 24 weeks): one study, 1095 women, from the UK. The evidence was very uncertain for all results relating to revealed versus concealed ultrasound scan (very low-certainty evidence). Early scans probably reduce short term maternal anxiety. Later scans may reduce labour induction for post-maturity.They may improve detection of major fetal abnormalities and increase the number of women who choose termination of pregnancy for this reason.They may also reduce the number of undetected twin pregnancies.All these findings accord with observational data. Neither type of scan appears to alter other important maternal or fetal outcomes, but our review may underestimate the e ect in modern practice because trials were mostly from relatively early in the development of the technology, and many control participants also had scans.The trials were also underpowered to show an e ect on other important maternal or fetal outcomes. Second trimester scans, at 14 to 24 weeks, increased detection of baby abnormalities, and more women chose termination of pregnancy for this reason.There was no evidence of an e ect on perinatal loss.Induction of labour to prevent the pregnancy going overdue was reduced. No studies reported how it a ected maternal anxiety.Multiple pregnancies were more likely to be detected by 24 weeks.Long-term followup of children exposed to these scans did not indicate that they were harmful to children\\'s physical or intellectual development. We also found one trial from a group of low and middle income countries, comparing a combination of two scans and specialist training of health professionals and referral of women with complications, with selective scans and routine care.The intervention did not alter the number of women delivering in a hospital with caesarean section facility.Nor did it appear to reduce maternal deaths or the numbers of low-birthweight babies, although the evidence was very uncertain. We also found one trial where all women underwent scans but the results were revealed to the health care professionals in half the cases.This trial showed no important e ect of revealing the scan results but the evidence was very uncertain. Most studies were carried out relatively early in the development of scan technology and when training in its use was less advanced.In most trials a large proportion of women in the control groups received a scan too. Early scans probably reduce maternal worries about the baby in the short term.Later scans may reduce labour induction to prevent the pregnancy going overdue.They may also improve detection of major abnormalities in the baby and increase the number of women who choose pregnancy termination for this reason.They may also reduce the number of undetected twin pregnancies.All these findings accord with common sense. Although neither type of scan appears to alter other important outcomes, our review may underestimate the e ect in modern practice because the trials were mostly from relatively early in the development of scan technology, and many participants in the control arms also had scans. Diagnostic ultrasound examination may be employed at various time points in pregnancy, o en in the first or second trimester of pregnancy.It may be done routinely as a screening test or selectively to investigate a suspected clinical problem.The assumption underlying routine ultrasound in all pregnancies is that it will enable earlier detection of potential problems and improve management of pregnancy complications.Conversely, the risks are that false positive results will do harm.The focus of this review is to measure the e ect of routine ultrasound examination performed before 24 completed weeks\\' gestation to that of selective or no ultrasound examination. Early pregnancy ultrasound examination might result in the earlier detection of abnormal pregnancy location, pregnancy viability, fetal structural abnormalities, molar pregnancy, multiple pregnancy and more accurate dating (Chen 2019; García Fernández 2019; Peek 1994) .Early detection of ectopic pregnancy may allow earlier and safer treatment.Early detection of fetal abnormality might o er opportunities for pregnancy termination, or occasionally other treatment.More accurate dating and early detection of multiple pregnancy, or abnormally invasive placentas, may also allow improved management later in the pregnancy (Peek 1994) .However, the examination may cause parental anxiety and false positive diagnoses may lead to iatrogenic harm (Barnett 2002; Salvesen 1995) . We included studies that compared routine ultrasound as a screening tool to selective ultrasound or no ultrasound.We included any ultrasound scan intended to be done before 24 weeks\\' gestation.Selective ultrasound is any clinician-initiated ultrasound that is not part of the patient\\'s routine care.Selective ultrasound examination may have been employed in a variety of specific circumstances during pregnancy; for example, if a woman presented with bleeding in early pregnancy or where the fetus was perceived to be at particularly high risk of malformation.We assessed both ultrasound in the first trimester (before 14 weeks) and in the second trimester (before 24 weeks). The focus of this review is routine ultrasound before 24 weeks\\' gestation; late pregnancy screening a er 24 weeks\\' gestation has been addressed in another Cochrane Review (Bricker 2015) . Ultrasound screening before 24 weeks\\' gestation could lead to earlier detection of pregnancy-related problems and thus allow improved management of these conditions (Glanc 2018; Peek 1994) . Many pregnant women appreciate seeing their baby on ultrasound. However, the diagnosis of potential fetal abnormalities may cause anxiety.It is therefore important to consider women\\'s satisfaction in having an ultrasound examination performed (Hofmeyr 2009) . Routine ultrasound before 24 weeks, especially in the first trimester, may improve the accuracy of pregnancy dating and thereby a ect the number of pregnancies undergoing induction for post-maturity (Middleton 2018). Routine ultrasound before 24 weeks\\' gestation may improve detection of placental problems, placenta praevia, placenta accreta and vasa praevia.Early detection of these high-risk pregnancies may improve clinical management (Panaiotova 2019). Early detection of multiple pregnancy may help pregnancy and birth planning in many ways.Early determination of chorionicity and amnionicity helps to detect pregnancies at highest risk for complications, allowing for early expert referral (Lee 2006) . For most fetal abnormalities, the gain from early and correct detection will be mediated by allowing women choices on pregnancy termination, and there are a few abnormalities where in utero treatment may be o ered (Chen 2019; García Fernández 2019) . The use of routine pregnancy ultrasound needs to be considered in the context of potential hazards and limited resources. Implementing routine ultrasound should be based on evidence of benefit.Will the information that clinicians can obtain from routine ultrasound alter their management and thus improve the pregnancy outcome?In addition, the psychological e ect of ultrasound examinations on pregnant women is important to consider.This may be either negative (for instance, anxiety following false-positive identification of fetal abnormality) or positive (for example, reduced anxiety). To assess the e ect of routine pregnancy ultrasound before 24 weeks as part of a screening programme, compared to selective ultrasound or no ultrasound, on the early diagnosis of abnormal pregnancy location, termination for fetal congenital abnormality, multiple pregnancy, maternal outcomes and later fetal compromise. To assess the e ect of first trimester (before 14 weeks) and second trimester (14 to 24 weeks) ultrasound, separately. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, cluster-RCTs.RCTs published only in abstract form were eligible if su icient information was available to assess eligibility and risk of bias.Cross-over studies were excluded. Pregnant women, before 24 weeks\\' gestation. Eligible interventions were routine or revealed ultrasound screening versus selective ultrasound, or concealed ultrasound or no ultrasound for both the \\'first trimester\\' and \\'second trimester\\' of pregnancy.Revealed ultrasound means that results are communicated to both patient and doctor and concealed ultrasound means that the results are blinded to both patient and doctor.We included studies with ultrasound examinations at any time before 24 weeks. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. We defined \\'first trimester\\' as earlier than 14 weeks.We defined \\'second trimester\\' as 14 weeks or later. 1. Maternal anxiety 2. Perinatal loss (defined as miscarriage, termination of pregnancy or intrauterine death a er trial entry, or death of a liveborn infant up to 28 days of age or before discharge from hospital). As requested by the World Health Organization (WHO), we have added the following non-prespecified similar outcomes: Perinatal death (fetal death a er 24 completed weeks gestation and before six completed days of life), perinatal death, excluding those because of lethal malformations, miscarriage (fetal loss before 20 weeks). Diagnoses of the following conditions The following methods section of this review is based on a standard template used by Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth. We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth\\'s Trials Register by contacting their Information Specialist (11 August 2020).Search results are screened by two people and the full text of all relevant trial reports identified through the searching activities described above is reviewed.Based on the intervention described, each trial report is assigned a number that corresponds to a specific Pregnancy and Childbirth review topic (or topics), and is then added to the Register.The Information Specialist searches the Register for each review using this topic number rather than keywords.This results in a more specific search set that will be fully accounted for in the relevant review sections (Included studies, Excluded studies, Studies awaiting classification or Ongoing studies). Using the search methods detailed in Appendix 1. we also searched ClinicalTrials.govand the available databases that contribute to the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (11 August 2020) for unpublished, planned and ongoing trial reports. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. We also searched the reference lists of retrieved studies. We did not apply any language or date restrictions Two review authors independently assessed for inclusion all the potential studies we identified as a result of the search strategy.We resolved any disagreement through discussion or, if required, we consulted a third senior review author. We created a study flow diagram to map out the number of records identified, included and excluded: Figure 1 . All studies meeting our inclusion criteria were also evaluated by two review authors against predefined criteria to select studies that were deemed to be su iciently trustworthy to be included in the analysis, based on available information. • No prospective trial registration for studies published a er 2010 without plausible explanation • When requested, trial authors refuse to provide/share the protocol and/or ethics approval letter • Implausible results (e.g.massive risk reduction for main outcomes with small sample size) • Unexpectedly even numbers of women \\'randomised\\' including a mismatch between the numbers and the methods, e.g. if they say no blocking was used but still end up with equal numbers, or they say they used blocks of four but the final numbers di er by six. Studies assessed as being potentially \\'high risk\\' would not be included in the review.Where a study was classified as \\'high risk\\' for one or more of the above criteria, we planned to contact the study authors to address any possible lack of information or concerns.If adequate information remained unavailable, the study would remain in \\'Studies awaiting classification\\' and the concerns and communications with the author (or lack of communication) described. Data from abstracts would only be included if, in addition to the trustworthiness assessment, the study authors confirmed in writing that the data to be included in the review had come from the final analysis and would not change.If such information was not available or not provided, we planned that the study would remain in \\'Studies awaiting classification\\'. We designed a form to extract data.For eligible studies, at least two review authors extracted the data using the agreed form.We resolved discrepancies through discussion, or, if required, through consultation with a third review author.We entered data into Review Manager 5 so ware (RevMan 2014) and checked these data for accuracy.When information regarding any of the above was unclear, we attempted to contact authors of the original reports to obtain further details. Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011) .We resolved any disagreement by discussion or by involving a third review author. For cluster-randomised trials, we paid particular attention to the following risk of bias: recruitment bias; baseline imbalance; loss of clusters; incorrect analysis; and comparability with individually randomised trials, as outlined in the Cochrane Handbook section 16. 3.2 and 16.4.3 (Higgins 2011) .For individually randomised trials, we assessed the following domains or risk of bias. ( We have described for each included study the method used to generate the allocation sequence in su icient detail to allow an assessment of whether it should produce comparable groups. We assessed the method as: • low risk of bias (any truly random process, e.g.random number table; computer random number generator); • high risk of bias (any non-random process, e.g.odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number); • unclear risk of bias. ( We have described for each included study the method used to conceal allocation to interventions prior to assignment and will assess whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during recruitment, or changed a er assignment. We assessed the methods as: • low risk of bias (e.g.telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes); • high risk of bias (open random allocation; unsealed or nonopaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth); • unclear risk of bias. Achieving e ective blinding for an intervention such as ultrasound is di icult, however, we have described for each included study any attempt to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received.We considered that studies were at low risk of bias if they were blinded, or if we judged that the lack of blinding would be unlikely to a ect results.We assessed blinding separately for di erent outcomes or classes of outcomes. We assessed the methods as: • low, high or unclear risk of bias for participants; • low, high or unclear risk of bias for personnel. For use in our GRADE assessment of the certainty of evidence, we have defined the term \\'process outcome\\'.We defined a \\'process outcome\\' as a variable that is part of the care pathway that is being guided (and altered) by the ultrasound result.The intervention in a \\'process outcomes\\' is not only the test (ultrasound) but patient management guided by test result (ultrasound finding); therefore, lack of blinding does not apply as a reason to downgrade.However, all other criteria for the assessment of the certainty of evidence still apply. The following are the process outcomes, for which lack of blinding does not apply as a reason to downgrade: • birth in a risk-appropriate setting; • number of fetal ultrasound scans; • number of antenatal visits; • antenatal hospital admission (WHO-requested outcome); • antenatal care utilisation (four or more visits) (WHO-requested outcome); • induction of labour for post-maturity; • termination of pregnancy for major anomaly; • appropriately timed serum screening tests (WHO-requested outcome); • appropriately timed anomaly scan (18 to 22 weeks) (WHOrequested outcome). Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews We have described for each included study the methods used, if any, to blind outcome assessors from knowledge of which intervention a participant received.We assessed blinding separately for di erent outcomes or classes of outcomes. We assessed methods used to blind outcome assessment as: • low, high or unclear risk of bias. For use in our GRADE assessment of the certainty of evidence, we have defined the term \\'process outcome\\'.We defined a \\'process outcome\\' as a variable that is part of the care pathway that is being guided (and altered) by the ultrasound result.The intervention in a \\'process outcomes\\' is not only the test (ultrasound) but patient management guided by test result (ultrasound finding); therefore, lack of blinding does not apply as a reason to downgrade.However, all other criteria for the assessment of the certainty of evidence still apply.

We have described for each included study, and for each outcome or class of outcomes, the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis.We have stated whether attrition and exclusions were reported and the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes.Where su icient information was reported, or supplied by the trial authors, we planned to re-include missing data in the analyses. We assessed methods as: • low risk of bias (e.g.no missing outcome data; missing outcome data balanced across groups); • high risk of bias (e.g.numbers or reasons for missing data imbalanced across groups; \\'as treated\\' analysis done with substantial departure of intervention received from that assigned at randomisation); • unclear risk of bias. We used a cut-o point of 10% to specify the level of missing data used to assess that a study was at low risk of bias. We have described for each included study how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We assessed the methods as: • low risk of bias (where it is clear that all of the study\\'s prespecified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported); • high risk of bias (where not all the study\\'s pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported); or the study was not registered.• unclear risk of bias. We have described for each included study any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias. Concerns about bias could include for example, was there a potential source of bias related to the specific study design?Was the trial stopped early due to some data-dependent process?Was there extreme baseline imbalance?Has the study been claimed to be fraudulent? We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias: • low risk of other bias; • high risk of other bias; • unclear whether there is risk of other bias. We made explicit judgements about whether studies were at high risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the Handbook (Higgins 2011) .With reference to (1) to ( 6) above, we assessed the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and whether we considered it was likely to impact on the findings. Where data were available we combined results from studies in meta-analysis. For dichotomous data, we have presented results as summary risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous data, we used the mean di erence (MD) if outcomes were measured in the same way between trials.We planned to use the standardised mean di erence (SMD) to combine trials that measured the same outcome, but used di erent methods.We applied the following assessment to the data before inclusion in a meta-analysis: for scale-derived continuous data, SDs and means Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews would have to be available; Otherwise, we did not include such data in meta-analysis, but instead have presented them in the text. We included a cluster-randomised trial in the analyses.We had planned to adjust results from such trials using the methods described in the Handbook using an estimate of the intracluster correlation co-e icient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), from a similar trial or from a study of a similar population.However, the trial authors of the included trial presented data that had already been adjusted for cluster design e ect, and as recommended we used this adjusted data in our analyses.We considered that the intervention in the cluster trial (including training of healthcare sta and broader community activities) meant that it was not appropriate to combine it with other studies in meta-analysis. If, in the future, we identify further cluster trials we plan to synthesise the relevant information.We will consider it reasonable to combine the results from both individual and clusterrandomised trials if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs, and the interaction between the e ect of intervention and the choice of randomisation unit is considered to be unlikely. We will also acknowledge heterogeneity in the randomisation unit and perform an analysis to investigate the e ects of the randomisation unit. For included studies, we have noted levels of attrition.We had planned to explore the impact of including studies with high levels of missing data in the overall assessment of treatment e ect by using sensitivity analysis, however, attrition in the included studies was relatively low. For all outcomes, we carried out analyses, as far as possible, on an intention-to-treat basis, i.e. we attempted to include all participants randomised to each group in the analyses, with all participants analysed in the group to which they were allocated, regardless of whether or not they received the allocated intervention.The denominator for each outcome in each trial is the number randomised minus any participants whose outcomes are known to be missing. For dichotomous outcome data, when synthesizing undesirable outcomes, such as mortality or adverse events, we assumed the event rate of a given outcome is the same in the missing population as it is in the completer population and planned therefore calculate the rate of an event in the completer population and apply it to the missing population to obtain the assumed number of event for intention-to-treat analysis.In the event we did not carry out this planned analyses as the number of deaths and serious adverse events were very similar in the control and intervention groups and overall sample loss was low.We did not apply this missing data assumption to desirable outcomes or to continuous outcome data.If missing data were greater than 10% in a trial, we planned to perform sensitivity analysis. We assessed statistical heterogeneity in each meta-analysis using the Tau , I and Chi statistics.We regarded heterogeneity as substantial if I was greater than 30% and either Tau was greater than zero, or there was a low P value (less than 0.10) in the Chi test for heterogeneity. If there were 10 or more studies in the meta-analysis we planned to investigate reporting biases (such as publication bias) using funnel plots.We would assess funnel plot asymmetry visually and if asymmetry was suggested by a visual assessment, we would perform exploratory analyses to investigate it.In this version of the review none of the meta-analyses included 10 or more trials. We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager 5 so ware (RevMan 2014).We used fixed-e ect meta-analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies are estimating the same underlying treatment e ect: i.e.where trials are examining the same intervention, and the trials\\' populations and methods are judged su iciently similar.If there was clinical heterogeneity su icient to expect that the underlying treatment e ects would di er between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we used a random-e ects metaanalysis to produce an overall summary provided an average treatment e ect across trials was considered clinically meaningful.The random-e ects summary has been treated as the average of the range of possible treatment e ects and we have discussed the clinical implications of treatment e ects di ering between trials.If the average treatment e ect was not considered clinically meaningful we planned not to combine trials. When we used random-e ects analyses, the results have been presented as the average treatment e ect with 95% CIs, and the estimates of Tau and I . We did not plan to carry out subgroup analysis. We planned to carry out sensitivity analysis to explore the e ect of trial quality assessed by random sequence generation and allocation concealment, high attrition rate (10%), or both, with poor-quality studies being excluded from the analyses in order to assess whether this makes any di erence to the overall result.We did not carry out this planned further analysis as overall attrition rate was very low.Overall attrition was fairly low and we considered that only one study was at high risk of bias for randomisation and this study contributed few data, so we did not consider that further analysis would throw any more light on results. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach as outlined in the GRADE handbook in order to assess the certainty of the body of evidence relating to the following outcomes: Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2. Perinatal loss (defined as miscarriage including termination of pregnancy or intrauterine death a er trial entry, or death of a liveborn infant up to 28 days of age or before discharge from hospital) 3. Termination for major abnormality 4. Induction of labour rate for post-maturity 5. Birth before 34 weeks\\' gestation. GRADEpro Guideline Development Tool was used to import data from Review Manager 5.3 (RevMan 2014) in order to create \\'Summary of findings\\' tables.A summary of the intervention e ect and a measure of certainty for each of the above outcomes was produced using the GRADE approach.The GRADE approach uses five considerations (study limitations, consistency of e ect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the certainty of the body of evidence for each outcome.With RCT data, evidence can be downgraded from \\'high certainty\\' by one level for serious (or by two levels for very serious) limitations, depending on assessments for risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of e ect estimates or potential publication bias.Summary of findings for the main comparison can be found in Summary of findings 1. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. The literature search identified 85 relevant papers reporting findings from 32 trials examining ultrasound for fetal assessment before 24 weeks of pregnancy.Trials included 140,417 women.Most studies resulted in several publications or reports.A total of 13 randomised trials (53 reports) were eligible for inclusion in the review. We have included data from 12 RCTs including 37,842 women, along with one large cluster-randomised trial that included an additional 47,421 deliveries (Goldenberg 2018) . Three trials (six reports) had no published data (Belanger 1996; Snaith 2004; Wald 1988) .We contacted the authors of these studies and assigned these records to Studies awaiting classification.We added three new trials (six reports) to Ongoing studies a er we contacted the authors (Figueras 2017; Pietersma 2018; Richter 2020).We excluded a further 13 studies (20 reports). From the 13 studies included in this review, three did not meet our criteria for trustworthiness, for the following reasons. • We were unsuccessful in our attempt to contact the authors of two studies.Two studies were published only as abstracts and we have not been able to confirm with the trial authors that the data were from the final analyses (Belanger 1996 , Snaith 2004 ).• For one study, only the trial registration was published, and we were not able to obtain study data from the final analyses from the authors (Wald 1988).Wald 1988, also did not respond to requests to the authors of the previous Cochrane Review (Whitworth 2015); to date, no results of this study are available. In all cases, we made every e ort to contact the study authors.See Studies awaiting classification. All of the trials included an intervention involving an ultrasound examination before 24 weeks of pregnancy.The dates of the scans, and the number of scans women received, varied in di erent trials.In the Crowther 1999 trial, women were randomised either to routine ultrasound at their first visit or routine care.Both groups completed a questionnaire at the end of the first antenatal visit on their feelings about the pregnancy and their anxiety levels, which were measured on a Likert scale.The Likert scale was used to assess how \\'worried\\', \\'relaxed\\' and \\'excited\\' the women felt about their pregnancies.Responses to these questions could range from \\'not at all\\' to \\'very\\'.Crowther 1999 recruited participants between 1991 and 1995.Information on funding sources or declarations of interest were not reported. Early ultrasound examination between 10 and 12 weeks\\' gestation (but up to 18 weeks) versus routine care with selective scan was the design of the Ewigman 1990 trial, which Similarly, in all included studies, women in the intervention group were o ered a \\'routine\\' scan, whilst those in the control groups received a scan at the discretion of the clinical sta (\\'selective scans\\').Ultrasound scans in the intervention group may have been the only \\'routine\\' scan o ered, or it may have been an additional scan, with women in both intervention and control groups having scans scheduled at a later stage of pregnancy. Routine ultrasound screening at 15 weeks versus selective scan was the trial design of Waldenstrom 1988, which  Sample sizes varied in trials, from 218 in a trial in Canada (Bennett 2004 ) to 15,151 women in a US trial (RADIUS 1993) .There was also a large multi-country cluster trial, with 47,431 births during the study period (Goldenberg 2018) . The earliest trials recruited women in the late 1970s and early 1980s (Bakketeig 1984; Bennett 1982; Eik-Nes 1984; Salvesen 1993a) .Trials were mainly conducted in high-resource settings including Australia (Crowther 1999) , Canada (Bennett 2004 ), Finland (Saari-Kemppainen 1994) , Norway (Bakketeig 1984; Eik-Nes 1984) , Sweden (Waldenstrom 1988) , UK (Bennett 1982; Harrington 2006 ) and USA (Ewigman 1990; RADIUS 1993) ; two trials were carried out in a middle-income country, namely South Africa (Geerts 1996; van Dyk 2007) .The large cluster trial recruited women between 2014 and 2016 and was conducted in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Guatemala, Kenya, Pakistan and Zambia (Goldenberg 2018) . All trials recruited pregnant women.Most women able to give consent were eligible for inclusion.Depending on the time of the intervention women were recruited as early as eight weeks\\' gestation and up to 24 weeks. Eligible comparisons included: first trimester routine scan versus selective or no scan; second trimester routine scan versus no scan; and revealed ultrasound results (communicated to both patient and doctor) versus concealed ultrasound results (blinded to both patient and doctor) at any time before 24 weeks. As in all trials women in the control group received an ultrasound if clinically indicated, there was no true \\'no scan\\' control group. Furthermore, there was one trial that took place in low-andmiddle income countries and not only included a routine scan in the intervention group, but also a co-intervention of training of healthcare workers and a referral for complications, we have added this trial to its own comparison.Therefore, the types of interventions covered in this review are: 1. First trimester routine scan versus selective scan; 2. Second trimester routine scan versus selective scan; 3. Standard care plus two ultrasounds, and co-intervention of training of healthcare workers and referral for complications versus standard care with selective scan; 4. Revealed (ultrasound results communicated to both patient and doctor) versus concealed (ultrasound results blinded to both doctor and patient) scan at any time before 24 weeks. We defined \\'first trimester\\' as earlier than 14 weeks.We defined \\'second trimester\\' as 14 weeks or later. Apart from the trial of revealed versus concealed results (Bennett 1982) , women in trials were randomised to receive a routine scan versus no routine scan.This is not to say that women in comparison groups were denied scans.The control condition was usually \"selective\" scans or scans as \"clinically indicated\" (requested by doctors).This meant that in most trials a proportion of women in the control group, and sometimes a large proportion, also received scans.Further, trials frequently focused on evaluating an additional scan; for example, an early dating scan.However, in addition a later fetal anomaly scan would be o ered to women in both intervention and control groups.For this reason, our comparisons are between women receiving an intervention scan versus a selective scan, rather than no scan.We have described in the Characteristics of included studies tables the control conditions and (where this was reported) the number of women in control groups receiving selective scans.In three of the trials included in the second trimester comparison, women in the intervention group were also o ered trial scans in the third trimester (at approximately 32 weeks) (Bakketeig 1984; Eik-Nes 1984; RADIUS 1993) . Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. The aims of scans varied across trials and several of our prespecified outcomes were not well-reported in trials.Our primary outcomes, overall fetal and perinatal loss, were not reported in the same way in all trials; dates and reasons for loss were not always apparent.In our results section we have reported both overall fetal and perinatal loss and where data was available, we have reported data for separate categories of loss (termination of pregnancy, miscarriage, stillbirth and neonatal death).Very little information was available on our second primary outcome: maternal anxiety, and we have no data from these trials on whether scans are associated with any longer-term impact on maternal psychological well-being. We have reported results for several outcomes we had not prespecified in the protocol.Findings from the review will be included in a WHO guideline on antenatal care, and WHO report on several key outcomes including for example low infant birthweight (< 2500 g) and small-for-gestational-age infant.We have therefore reported on these outcomes if data were available; but have indicated that these were not pre-specified. We excluded 13 studies (Chen 2008; Du 1993; Hoglund Carlsson 2016; Larsen 1992; Leung 2006; Nelson 2017; Owen 1994; Rustico 2005; Saltvedt 2006; Schifano 2010; Schwarzler 1999; Votino 2012; Zhang 2018 ). In the Chen 2008 and the Votino 2012 trials, all participants (in both the intervention and control groups) received early ultrasound scans.In the four studies by Hoglund Carlsson 2016; Saltvedt 2006; Schwarzler 1999; and Zhang 2018, the timing of scans was examined (i.e. earlier versus later scans). In the Du 1993 trial, all participants (in both the intervention and control groups) received an early scan and women in the intervention group had an additional scan in the third trimester. In Larsen 1992, all participants (in both the intervention and control groups) received early scans and both groups received serial ultrasound scans from 28 weeks.Both groups received scans in the third trimester in the Nelson 2017 trial.Owen 1994 looked at women with a high risk of fetal anomaly, with women in the intervention group receiving more frequent scans. Three trials compared two versus three or four dimensional ultrasound scans (Leung 2006; Rustico 2005; Schifano 2010 ). Please find details in Figure 3 and Figure 4 . Four of the included trials were assessed to be at low risk of bias for both sequence generation and allocation concealment (Bennett 2004; Crowther 1999; Goldenberg 2018; Harrington 2006) .Two studies were assessed as being at high risk of bias (Bennett 1982; van Dyk 2007) for both sequence generation and allocation concealment.For the rest, studies did not describe methods fully and were therefore assessed as unclear for at least one of the two domains relating to allocation. The nature of the intervention meant that it was not possible to adequately blind women and sta providing care to treatment allocation.In one study (Bennett 1982) women were randomised to revealed/concealed results; thus, all women had scans, and may not have been aware of the randomisation group.However, even in this study, sta providing care would have been aware of whether or not scan results were in women\\'s maternity case notes.In the remaining studies, women who had scans would have been fully aware of the intervention, and women in control groups aware that they had not had scans.Whether or not women had scans might impact on women\\'s behaviour and on the behaviour of sta providing care (for example, requests for additional tests or interventions).The impact of lack of blinding on outcomes was not simple to assess but all studies were assessed as being at high or unclear risk of bias for blinding. Sample attrition was mainly low in these trials and outcome data were available for most women recruited.In two studies there was sample loss, or loss was not balanced across groups (Bakketeig 1984; Ewigman 1990 ); we assessed these to be at high risk of bias.In another study, there was insu icient information on sample attrition or missing data, and this study was assessed to be at unclear risk of bias for this domain (Goldenberg 2018) . Many of these trials were conducted before it was customary for all trials to be registered and for protocols to be published before studies commenced.Four studies were assessed as high risk of bias for this domain, but this was mainly due to lack of information (Bennett 1982; Bennett 2004; RADIUS 1993; Saari-Kemppainen 1994) . We assessed that five trials were at high risk of bias for other sources of bias.The Harrington 2006 trial was stopped early.In other trials (Bennett 1982; Ewigman 1990; RADIUS 1993; Saari-Kemppainen 1994) there were other factors that meant results were more di icult to interpret.Protocol deviation was a particular issue in these studies, with large proportions of women in the control groups undergoing scans and, or women in the intervention group not attending for trial interventions. In the Goldenberg 2018 trial, the authors made adjustments for design e ect; the adjusted numbers were used whenever possible for the purposes of the review.There was some protocol deviation.In the intervention clusters, 77.6% of women received at least one study ultrasound.There was considerable variation in di erent settings with regard to ultrasound use in control groups (95% in Pakistan versus less than 5% in African countries). Other considerations: clusters were stratified by country and took account of baseline di erences among settings.However, there was huge variation among cluster sites in terms of baseline mortality rates and maternity care provision and utilisation.Stillbirth rates ranged between 22 to 54 per 1000 and neonatal mortality between 16 to 45 per 1000 infants.Baseline caesarean section rates ranged from 0.1% in Democratic Republic of Congo to 11.4% in Guatemala.Birth location and birth attendant also varied considerably.Despite adjustment to take account of cluster design, these large variations among sites means that overall results are more di icult to interpret. In the van Dyk 2007trial, all participants who presented on a certain day would be randomised to either the intervention group or the control group.On some days, women were randomised to ultrasound scanning, and some days to routine care.In the control routine care group, 21.9% of women received an ultrasound scan for clinical reasons; therefore, we decided to include the trial in the routine versus selective ultrasound comparison.There was no adjustment for any possible variation on di erent days.The analysis of the results was at the level of individual women. See: Summary of findings 1 First trimester routine compared to selective ultrasound for fetal assessment before 24 weeks\\' gestation; Summary of findings 2 Second trimester routine versus selective ultrasound for fetal assessment before 24 weeks\\' gestation Four studies contributed to this comparison (Bennett 2004; Crowther 1999; Ewigman 1990; Harrington 2006) . This outcome was reported in one trial (Crowther 1999) , which included 648 women with 634 women completing an anxiety questionnaire at the end of their first antenatal visit.The evidence suggests that women undergoing routine first trimester scans are probably less worried about their pregnancy a er the scan (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.99; 634 participants, one study; moderate-certainty evidence, downgraded due to study design limitations).However, women had no long-term follow-up, and it is not clear whether this e ect was sustained throughout pregnancy (Analysis 1.1). One trial (Crowther 1999 ) reported perinatal loss.The evidence is very uncertain about the e ect of first trimester scans on pregnancy loss between screened and unscreened groups, giving a di erence of 0.65% versus 0.67%, respectively, because the 95% CI is compatible with a wide range of e ects that encompass both appreciable benefit and also harm (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.73 ; 648 participants, one study; low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to study design limitations and imprecision) (Analysis 1.2).When assessing only perinatal death, the results were very uncertain Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for women undergoing routine scans compared with controls (perinatal death is defined as fetal death a er 24 completed weeks gestation and before six completed days of life).The unweighted di erence was 0.07% versus 0.09%, respectively (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.23 to 2.31; 1472 participants, two studies; very low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to a low event rate and imprecision) (Analysis 1.3).Even when excluding lethal abnormalities, compared with controls, there was not enough evidence that first trimester routine scans made any di erence in perinatal death (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.82; 824 participants, one study) (Analysis 1.4).For miscarriage before 20 weeks, there may be little to no di erence between the groups (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.24; 1111 participants, two studies; low-certainty evidence, downgraded for imprecision due to a low event rate and wide 95% CI crossing the line of no e ect) (Analysis 1.5). One study (Harrington 2006) with 463 women reported one IUFD in the routine scan group as compared to none in the selective scan group.The evidence is very uncertain about the e ect of first trimester routine scan on the occurrence of IUFD (RR 2.96, 95% CI 0.12 to 72.32; 463 participants, one study; low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to study design limitations and imprecision.Imprecision was due to a low event rate and wide 95% CI crossing the line of no e ect) ( Analysis 1.6). There was only one study comparing first trimester routine scan to selective scan regarding detecting multiple pregnancy before 24 to 26 weeks\\' gestation.Both sets of twins were detected in the screening group, whereas only five out of seven sets of twins (71%) were detected in the selective scan group (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.03 to 8.19; nine multiple pregnancies, one study; low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to study design limitations and imprecision.Imprecision was due to a low event rate and sample size and wide 95% CI crossing the line of no e ect) (Analysis 1.7).The same study also assessed diagnosis of twins a er the onset of labour.Both sets of twins were diagnosed before labour in the screening group, and six out of seven sets of twins (85%) were identified before labour in the control group (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.05 to 16.36; nine multiple pregnancies, one study; low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to study design limitations and imprecision.Imprecision was due to a low event rate, small sample size and wide 95% CI crossing the line of no e ect) (Analysis 1.8). One study reported detection of ectopic pregnancy prior to clinical presentation (suspected and confirmed by either surgical and/or medical treatment and/or histopathology).There was insu icient evidence to determine whether first trimester scans make any di erence in diagnosing ectopic pregnancy before clinical presentation.There was a single ectopic pregnancy in the screened group that was detected before clinical presentation and no ectopic pregnancies in the control group (RR 2.74, 95% CI 0.11 to 66.51; 218 participants, one study; very low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to study design limitations and imprecision.Imprecision was due to a low event rate, small sample size and wide 95% CI crossing the line of no e ect) ( Analysis 1.9). The evidence is very uncertain about the e ect of a routine first trimester ultrasound on the number of women undergoing birth by caesarean section due to wide CIs (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.61; 1253 participants, three studies; low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to study design limitations and imprecision) (Analysis 1.10). The evidence is very uncertain about the e ect of a routine first trimester scan on the number of inductions of labour for postmaturity pregnancy (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.37; 1474 participants, three studies; low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to study design limitations and imprecision) (Analysis 1.11), or inductions of labour for any reason (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.09; 463 participants, one study; low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to study design limitations and imprecision) (Analysis 1.12). The evidence is very uncertain on whether a first trimester scan makes any di erence to the number of women undergoing termination for any cause (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.14 to 6.95; 463 participants, one study; very low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to study design limitations and very serious imprecision) (Analysis 1.13).There are no data to assess whether first trimester ultrasound made a di erence in a woman\\'s choice to terminate for major abnormality. One study reported on first trimester screening and appropriately timed serum screening.The evidence is very uncertain about the e ect of a first trimester routine scan on the number of women requiring repeat serum screening (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.76; 602 participants, one study) (Analysis 1.14). A first trimester routine scan may make little to no di erence to the number of women not having an appropriately timed detailed ultrasound examination (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.08; 602 participants, one study) (Analysis 1.15). One study reported that a first trimester scan may make little to no di erence to serious neonatal morbidity (composite outcome including hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy, intraventricular haemorrhage, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotising enterocolitis) (Ewigman 1990 ) (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.39; 824 participants, one study; low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to study design limitations and imprecision) ( Analysis 1.16). The evidence is very uncertain about the e ect of first trimester scan on low infant birthweight (less than 2500 g) (RR 2.01, 95% CI 0.99 to 4.08; 594 participants, one study; low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to study design limitations and imprecision) (Analysis 1.17). Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. The following outcomes were not reported in the studies in this comparison.Eight studies contributed to this comparison (Bakketeig 1984; Eik-Nes 1984; Geerts 1996; RADIUS 1993; Saari-Kemppainen 1994; van Dyk 2007; Waldenstrom 1988; Goldenberg 2018 ).However one trial, Goldenberg 2018, involved a co-intervention of training sonographers and referral for complications and was the only trial in low-and middle-income countries; therefore, this trial was analysed separately in Comparison 3. This outcome was not reported in any of the trials. Intrauterine fetal death (all fetal losses at or a er 20 weeks\\' gestation) Four studies reported on IUFD and show little to no di erence in the routine scan group versus selective scan (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.42; 29,584 participants, three studies; low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to study design limitations and imprecision. Imprecision was due to a low event rate and wide 95% CI crossing the line of no e ect) (Analysis 2.5). Routine second trimester ultrasound may reduce non-detection of multiple pregnancy before 24 to 26 weeks\\' gestation (RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.16; 274 participants, five studies; low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to study limitations) (Analysis 2.6). There is little evidence that routine second trimester ultrasound makes a di erence in the detection of multiple pregnancy before labour (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.74; 135 participants, three studies) (Analysis 2.7). One trial carried out in South Africa presented data on the mean number of ultrasound scans (Geerts 1996) .Selective ultrasound resulted in a lower mean number of ultrasound scans as compared to routine ultrasound.In this study, women in the routine ultrasound group had an average of 1.2 scans compared with an average of 0. There was little to no evidence of a di erence in number of antenatal hospital admissions between the routine ultrasound group and controls (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.27; 16,836 participants, five studies) and the mean number of antenatal visits (MD 0.08, 95% CI -0.30 to 0.46; 10,306 participants, three studies) was similar in both groups (Analysis 2.10; Analysis 2.9).A trial in South Africa reported a mean number of hospital visits, which was 5.8 +/-1.8 in the screening group versus 5.9 +/-2.0 in the selective scan group (van Dyk 2007). The evidence suggests that a second trimester routine ultrasound makes little or no di erence to the number of women undergoing caesarean section (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.12; 22,193 participants, five studies; low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to study design limitations) (Analysis 2.11).

Routine ultrasound in the second trimester may reduce induction of labour for suspected post-maturity (average RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.73; 24,174 participants, six studies; low-certainty evidence, downgraded for study limitations and heterogeneity.Due to heterogeneity we used random-e ects analysis for this outcome) (Analysis 2.12).Furthermore, induction of labour for any cause may be reduced, however there was high heterogeneity for this outcome and again we used random e ects analysis (average RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.00; 23,267 participants, five studies; lowcertainty evidence) (Analysis 2.13). The evidence is very uncertain about the e ect of routine second trimester scan on the number of women terminating pregnancy for any cause (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.14 to 6.95; 463 participants, one study; low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to study limitations and imprecision) (Analysis 2.14). Routine second trimester ultrasound may increase detection of major fetal abnormality before 24 weeks (RR 3.45, 95% CI 1.67 to 7.12; 387 participants, two studies; low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to design limitations and imprecision.Imprecision due to low event rate and sample size) (Analysis 2.15). Routine second trimester scan probably increases the number of women terminating pregnancy for major anomaly (RR 2.36, 95% CI 1.13 to 4.93; 26,893 participants, four studies; moderate-certainty evidence, downgraded due to study limitations) (Analysis 2.16). The large RADIUS 1993 study reported on a composite outcome for serious neonatal morbidity and there was very little di erence between the ultrasound and control groups (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.36; 15,281 participants, one study) (Analysis 2.17). Routine versus selective ultrasound may make little or no di erence to neonatal death (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.28; 25,396 participants, three studies; low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to study design limitations) (Analysis 2.18). The evidence suggests little to no di erence in admission of infants to intensive or special care unit (definitions may not have been the same in all studies) (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.01; 17,484 participants, six studies) (Analysis 2.19). There is no evidence of a di erence in mean birthweight between the two groups (MD 16.79, 95% CI -6.44 to 40.03; 23,177 participants, five studies) (Analysis 2.20). There was little to no di erence between groups for low birthweight (< 2500 g) (average RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.74 to One study reported the number of infants that were small for gestational age and there was no evidence of a di erence between groups (RR 1.47, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.35; 964 participants, one study) (Analysis 2.23). A follow-up into childhood of 603 babies included in the Bakketeig 1984 trial suggested that the evidence is uncertain of whether scans during pregnancy have any e ect on dyslexia due to imprecision of results (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.34; 603 participants, one study; low-certainty evidence) (Analysis 2.24). There were no data to assess the e ects of routine ultrasound on the overall cost of care, but RADIUS 1993 estimated the average costs of routine ultrasound to be USD 200/scan, or USD 89.28 per patient. The following outcomes were not reported in the studies in this comparison.Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews review outcomes.We used the generic inverse variance method in our data and analysis; although the total sample size is shown in the forest plots the event rates are not.We have therefore included event rates as part of our presentation of results in the text.However, these rates are for illustrative purposes only as they do not reflect the adjustment made by the trialists in calculating relative e ects. This outcome was not reported in the trial. Perinatal loss (defined as miscarriage including termination of pregnancy or intrauterine death a er trial entry, or death of a liveborn infant up to 28 days of age or before discharge from hospital). This outcome was not reported in the trial. Adjusted data suggests that standard care plus two ultrasounds, and co-intervention of training of healthcare workers and referral for complications probably makes little or no di erence to IUFD (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.04; 46,904 participants; moderate-certainty evidence, downgraded for study design limitations) (e ect estimate based on adjusted data: 675/24,254 versus 628/23,149 in the intervention and control groups respectively) (Analysis 3.1). The trial also assessed whether or not women with pregnancy complications gave birth in hospital with facilities for caesarean section; again there was little to no di erences between groups (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.19; 11,680 participants, one study; moderatecertainty evidence, downgraded for study design limitations) (e ect estimate based on adjusted data, actual data: 2569/6,152 versus 2252/5,528 in the intervention and control groups respectively (the numerators are the number of complicated labours) (Analysis 3.2). The trialists collected data on the number of women attending for antenatal visits on at least four occasions.Adjusted data suggests there is probably little or no di erence between groups (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.18; 46,904 participants, one study; moderatecertainty evidence, downgraded for study design limitations) (e ect estimate based on adjusted data; actual data: 12,021/24,008 versus 10,866/22,896 in the intervention and control groups respectively) (Analysis 3.3). Evidence suggests that standard care plus two ultrasounds, and co-intervention of training of healthcare workers and referral for complications may make little or no di erence to caesarean section (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.04; 46,904 participants, one study; lowcertainty evidence, downgraded for study design limitations and imprecision) (e ect estimate based on unadjusted data, actual data: 2919/24,008 versus 2808/22,896 in the intervention and control groups, respectively) (Analysis 3.4). The evidence is very uncertain about whether standard care plus two ultrasounds, and co-intervention of training of healthcare workers and referral for complications makes any di erence to maternal mortality (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.55; 46 ,768 participants, one study; low-certainty evidence, downgraded for study design limitations and imprecision) (e ect estimate based on unadjusted data: 28/23,923 versus 29/22,845 in the intervention and control groups respectively) (Analysis 3.5). The intervention also probably makes little or no di erence to neonatal death (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.14; 45,974 participants, one study; moderate-certainty evidence, downgraded for study design limitations) (e ect estimate based on adjusted data, actual data: 546/23,495 versus 543/22,479 in the intervention and control groups, respectively) (Analysis 3.6). Moderate-certainty evidence suggested the intervention probably makes little or no di erence to low birthweight (< 2500 g) (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.13; 47,312 One study contributed to this comparison with 1,095 women (Bennett 1982) . This outcome was not reported in the trial. Perinatal loss (defined as miscarriage including termination of pregnancy or intrauterine death a er trial entry, or death of a liveborn infant up to 28 days of age or before discharge from hospital) The evidence is very uncertain about the e ect of a revealed ultrasound scan compared to not revealed on pregnancy loss (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.57 to 3.14; 1062 participants, one study; very lowcertainty evidence, downgraded due to imprecision (wide 95% CI crossing the line of no e ect, single study and low event rate) (Analysis 4.1) and perinatal death (RR 1.67, 95% CI 0.40 to 6.94; 1062 participants, one study; very low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to imprecision (wide 95% CI crossing the line of no e ect, single study and low event rate) (Analysis 4.2).Even when excluding lethal abnormalities the evidence was still found to be of very uncertain for perinatal death (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.30 to 5.92; 1073 participants, one study; very low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to imprecision (wide 95% CI crossing the line of no e ect, single study and low event rate). The evidence is very uncertain about the e ect of revealed scans on IUFD (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.18 to 21.99; 1062 participants, one study; very low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to imprecision (wide 95% CI crossing the line of no e ect, single study and low event rate) (Analysis 4.4). The evidence is very uncertain about the e ect of revealed scans on detection of multiple pregnancy before 24-26 weeks (RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.92; 11 participants, one study; very low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to imprecision (wide 95% CI crossing the line of no e ect, single study and low event rate), respectively (Analysis 4.5). The evidence is very uncertain about the e ect of revealed scans on women undergoing induction of labour for any reason (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.24; 1062 participants, one study; very low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to imprecision (wide 95% CI crossing the line of no e ect, single study and low event rate) (Analysis 4.6). The evidence is very uncertain about the e ect of revealed scans on women undergoing termination of pregnancy for any cause (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.39 to 3.45; 1062 participants, one study; very lowcertainty evidence, downgraded due to imprecision (wide 95% CI crossing the line of no e ect, single study and low event rate).(Analysis 4.7). The evidence is very uncertain about the e ect of revealed scans on neonatal deaths (RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.25 to 8.94; 1062 participants, one study; very low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to imprecision (wide 95% CI crossing the line of no e ect, single study and low event rate) (Analysis 4.8). The evidence is very uncertain about the e ect of revealed scans on low birthweight (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.61; 1062 participants, one study; very low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to imprecision (wide 95% CI crossing the line of no e ect, single study and low event rate) (Analysis 4.9). The following outcomes were not reported in the study in this comparison. There is moderate-certainty evidence that first trimester scans probably reduces short-term maternal anxiety about pregnancy, but it is not clear if the e ect is sustained (moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the e ect of first trimester scans on pregnancy loss or inductions of labour for post-maturity (low-certainty evidence). The e ect of routine first trimester ultrasound on birth before 34 weeks or termination of pregnancy for fetal abnormality was not reported in studies. Second trimester scans probably makes little to no di erence to pregnancy loss or intrauterine fetal death (moderate-certainty evidence). Routine ultrasound in the second trimester may reduce induction of labour for suspected post-maturity (moderate-certainty evidence). Routine second trimester ultrasound may increase detection of major fetal abnormality before 24 weeks (moderate-certainty evidence) and probably increases the number of women terminating pregnancy for major anomaly (moderate-certainty evidence). Second trimester routine scans may reduce non-detection of multiple pregnancy before 24 to 26 weeks\\' gestation (low-certainty evidence). Long-term follow-up of children exposed to scans before birth did not indicate that scans are harmful to children\\'s physical or intellectual development (low-certainty evidence). The e ect of routine second trimester ultrasound on birth before 34 weeks or maternal anxiety was not reported in studies. The additional scans and interventions in the intervention arm probably makes little to no di erence to whether or not women with pregnancy complications gave birth in hospital with facilities for caesarean section (moderate-certainty evidence), low birth weight (< 2500 g) or maternal mortality. Revealed ultrasound results (communicated to both patient and doctor) versus concealed ultrasound results (blinded to both patient and doctor) at any time before 24 weeks) The evidence was very uncertain for all results relating to revealed versus concealed ultrasound scan (very low-certainty evidence). The review includes several large trials, although the eligibility criteria among the trials di er.Therefore, the results may not be generalisable to all women.Additionally, ultrasound itself is unlikely to improve maternal or fetal outcomes; rather, it will be the interventions that could be o ered, based on the information provided by ultrasound in particular situations, that alters outcomes. The majority of studies were carried out in high-resource settings where the overall level of perinatal mortality is low and the contribution of major fetal abnormality to mortality is higher than in lower-resource settings.Findings in high-resource settings may not apply in less-a luent settings and countries.One trial involving a complex intervention contributed data from low-and middleincome countries. The di erent studies were carried out over a time period of more than 30 years.During that time, changes in scanning guidelines, technical advances in equipment, more widespread use of ultrasonography in the world, and training and expertise of operators are likely to have resulted in more e ective sonography, particularly for the detection of fetal abnormalities. For many of the primary outcomes (maternal anxiety and perinatal loss) in this review, the authors recognised a lack of trial evidence. The review includes several large, well-designed trials.Lack of blinding is a problem common to all of the studies and this may have an e ect on some outcomes.In several studies, a high number of women in the control group also had ultrasound examinations, especially in the Goldenberg 2018 trial, which was a cluster-RCT conducted in several low-and middle-income countries.In some countries, up to 95% of women in the control group had an ultrasound, whereas in others, only very few women had a scan in the control arm.Key outcomes were adjusted by the trialists and the authors used them whenever available, as per Cochrane guidance. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence for all primary review outcomes.The certainty of evidence for maternal anxiety and perinatal death was low.Downgrading of evidence was based on including studies with design limitations, imprecision of results and presence of heterogeneity.For some of the outcomes, such as perinatal loss, the event rate was very low.The pooled Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews e ect was provided by studies with design limitations, including poor reporting of allocation concealment methods, in all GRADE outcomes.In two of the first trimester outcomes, we downgraded for serious imprecision, due to the wide 95% CI crossing the line of no e ect.In one second trimester outcome, we downgraded for inconsistency (serious heterogeneity, I = 68%). RCTs published before 1996 were done before the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement was first published, and therefore could not be compliant with its standards (Begg 1996) . The possibility of introducing bias was present at every stage of the reviewing process.We attempted to minimise bias in a number of ways: two review authors assessed eligibility for inclusion, carried out data extraction and assessed risk of bias.Each worked independently.Nevertheless, the process of assessing risk of bias, for example, is not an exact science and includes many personal judgements.Furthermore, the process of reviewing research studies is known to be a ected by prior beliefs and attitudes.It is di icult to control for this type of bias in the reviewing process. While we attempted to be as inclusive as possible in the search strategy, the literature identified was predominantly written in English and published in North American and European journals.Although we did attempt to assess reporting bias, constraints of time meant that this assessment largely relied on information available in the published trial reports and thus, reporting bias was not usually apparent. Our data showed that routine ultrasound before 14 weeks can reduce maternal anxiety around the time of the scan.Garcia 2002, a systematic review of studies on women\\'s views about antenatal screening and diagnosis illustrated how attractive ultrasound in pregnancy is to women and their partners.The review included 74 primary studies from 18 countries that employed a wide range of methods ranging from qualitative interviewing to psychometric testing.The main finding was that not all women were aware of the purpose of ultrasound scanning in pregnancy.This lack of knowledge le some women vulnerable to anxiety and disappointment if the scan detected a problem, especially in situations where women were not counselled that the scan was to screen for abnormalities.The lack of information on the intention of scanning before 24 weeks can do also lead to women believing that if no abnormalities are detected, this means that all must be well.The review recommended that parents need clear information about the purpose and limitations of scans.Women need to know what to expect so that they can make informed decisions about their care and so that they are prepared for potential abnormal findings. With regard to similar outcomes in this review, the RADIUS 1993 of 15,530 women assessed if screening ultrasound in low-risk pregnancies would improve perinatal outcomes.This trial showed no di erences in maternal outcomes and found similar rates of induced abortion and Caesarean section. This evidence suggests that first trimester ultrasound may reduce short-term anxiety in pregnancy.Second trimester routine ultrasound may reduce the numbers of inductions for postmaturity.Second trimester ultrasound may improve the detection of major fetal abnormalities and increases termination of pregnancies with fetal abnormality.It may reduce the number of undetected twin pregnancies by 24 weeks.This accords with observational data.This review may underestimate the e ect size in modern practice because the trials mostly date from relatively early in the development of the ultrasound technology and many participants in the control arms also underwent ultrasound.The evidence that neither first nor second trimester routine ultrasound alters other maternal or fetal outcomes may also be an e ect of the relatively low event rates of these outcomes or whether intervention is o ered or not, based on the information provided by ultrasound.First and second trimester ultrasound did not appear to increase or decrease the numbers of caesarean section and this may well be because many indications for caesarean section only become apparent in the third trimester of pregnancy. Future trials comparing routine with selective or no ultrasound will be di icult for two reasons.Firstly, ultrasound examinations are already widely used.Our observation of the large number of scans in the control groups in the trials we reviewed suggests that this problem a ected past trials in addition.Secondly, the sample sizes of any trial which had a reasonable chance of detecting a clinically important e ects on perinatal death, or any other substantive outcome, would need to be huge.For example, assuming a control group estimate of perinatal death of 3 per 1000, the majority of these being due to prematurity would not be altered by accurate dating.At most, accurate dating might reduce mortality to 2 per 1000.A trial to test such a hypothesis would require 39,000 per group (alpha 0.05, beta 0.2).A trial to test a more plausible hypothesis that perinatal mortality fell from 3 per 1000 to 2.8 per 1000 would require 1,135,000 participants per group.Such a trial is not feasible.Future research on the e ectiveness of scanning before 24 weeks could therefore be based on observational data.

Exclusion criteria: women found to not be pregnant, not willing to participate, induced abortion before randomisation Experimental intervention: (510 women).Ultrasound examinations in the 19th and 32nd weeks of pregnancy.The aim of the 19 week scan was to determine the number of fetuses, locate the placenta, measure fetal biparietal diameter to assess gestational age and predict expected date of delivery.The second scan assessed biparietal diameter, the mean abdominal diameter, final placental location and fetal presentation.67 women had additional scans. Comparison intervention: (499 women).Routine antenatal care with selective scan (41 women were referred for scans) Study prospectively registered: not reported There were no established growth curves for mean abdominal diameter at the onset of the study, therefore these measurements were not consistently used to detect growth retardation. Outcome assessment known to sta although it was stated that newborn outcomes were assessed by sta unaware of allocation, so these may have been at lower risk of bias High risk 54 of 510 (10.6%) women in the screening group failed to attend the first scan and an additional 33 (7.2%) failed to attend the second screening scan. Selective reporting (reporting bias) No prespecified outcomes.Not registered. Other bias Low risk Women were described as similar at baseline (and preliminary data supports this).

Exclusion criteria: women who had an indication for a first trimester ultrasound or already had an ultrasound examination, known multiple pregnancy, under 19 years old with no guardian present, or non consenting Interventions 218 women with singleton pregnancies were randomised, 10 women assigned to the intervention group and 12 to the control group had early pregnancy loss or were otherwise lost to follow up Methods Randomised controlled trial.Individual randomisation. Tertiary level hospital in Adelaide, Austalia Inclusion criteria: women were recruited at their first antenatal visit if this visit was before 17 weeks\\' gestation, they had no previous ultrasound scans in this pregnancy and were expected to give birth at the study hospital. Exclusion criteria: women were excluded if they had an indication for an ultrasound at their first antenatal visit. Interventions 648 women were recruited to the trial.Women were enrolled by telephone randomisation to either the intervention arm or the control arm. Experimental intervention: (321 women) Ultrasound examination at their first antenatal visit.The assessment included fetal cardiac activity, estimation of gestational age, limited assessment of fetal morphology and the number of fetuses present.The mean gestational age of these first visit scans was at 10.7 weeks (SD 2.7 weeks).The report of the scan was available to caregivers to plan timing of maternal serum screening bloods and the 18-20 weeks ultrasound morphology scan.(The report was not made available to the person carrying out the 18-20 week scan.) Comparison intervention: (327 women).Routine antenatal care, no scan at the first visit. Women in both groups completed an anxiety questionnaire at the end of their first antenatal visit. Women in both the intervention and control group had a routine 18-20 week ultrasound. Adjustment for gestational age, perinatal loss, anxiety at the end of the first visit (measured on a Likert scale), TOP for any reason, caesarean section (The primary outcomes (used in power calculation) in the study were adjustment of the estimated due date of 10 days or more on the basis of their morphology scan and women booked for serum screening blood tests and morphology scans at inappropriate gestational ages. Sta carrying out 18-20 week scans did not have access to earlier reports, but it was not clear whether they were aware that an earlier scan had been performed.Sta may have been aware of allocation when administering anxiety questionnaires. Low risk Primary analysis was on an ITT basis.Data available for 602/648 women randomised (93%).There were some missing data (22/321 women in the intervention group and 24/327 in the control group had no 18-20 week scan data). Missing data wee mainly accounted for by miscarriage which was balanced across groups. Selective reporting (reporting bias) The outcomes regarding anxiety were not fully explained and were not clear. Trial was registered and all relevant outcomes stated were reported in findings including non-significant results. There was no evidence of differences in baseline characteristics.It was not reported how many of the women attending the hospital were eligible for inclusion which may affect generalisability. Methods Randomised controlled trial.Individual randomisation. All women attending for their first antenatal care visit at the clinics of 35 general practitioners in Alesund, Norway.The study population is representative for pregnant women who lived in this region of Norway at that time. Inclusion criteria: women living in Alesund, Norway Exclusion criteria: non-consenting In total 1628 women were randomised. Experimental intervention: (825 women).Ultrasound examinations at 18th and 32th weeks of pregnancy.At 18th weeks the number of fetuses and the position of the placenta were recorded.A general examination of the fetus was carried out and biparietal diameter was measured to estimate gestational age.At 32 weeks biparietal diameter was measured to assess growth, placental position and fetal presentation were noted.If fetal growth restriction was suspected or presentation was breech women were offered a further scan at 36 weeks.In addition women were offered scans at any time if clinically indicated (on average women in the intervention group had 2.5 scans). Comparison intervention: (803 women).Routine antenatal care with selective scan.481/727 women with singleton pregnancies did not undergo scans. Sample size calculation on post-term inductions of labour, data collected on hospital admissions, infant size and condition at birth, perinatal mortality, twin pregnancies diagnosed before 26 weeks. Preliminary results from the trial were published as a letter in 1984 and reported a study population of 1628 women, of whom 809 were randomised to ultrasound screening and 819 were controls.In a later follow-up of the children at 8 or 9 years of age, it was disclosed that 825 women were randomised to screening and 803 women were randomised to be controls.Loss was balanced between groups, there were some missing data (< 10%) Selective reporting (reporting bias) Low risk Although study protocol is not available there was a re-analysis of data reported previously and appears accurate and complete Other bias Unclear risk Groups mainly appeared balanced at baseline but more women in the control group were non-smokers (69% vs 64%) (P value 0.02) Methods Randomised controlled trial.Stratified by participating practice size. Women attending 8 family physicians and eight hospital obstetricians at the University of Missouri Hospital and Clinics and Boone Hospital Center Columbia, Missouri, USA Inclusion criteria: women planning to continue pregnancy to term and planning delivery with 1 of the participating physicians, less than 18 weeks\\' gestation. Exclusion criteria: pre-existing indication for ultrasound (unknown gestational age, size/date discrepancy of 4 weeks, previous stillbirth, diabetes, chronic hypertension, chronic renal disease, etc.), planned amniocentesis, repeat caesarean section, gestational age already confirmed on ultrasound, suspected molar/ectopic pregnancy, threatened/inevitable miscarriage, fetal death, presence of IUD More than half of the women screened for inclusion were not eligible.915/2171 screened were randomised.Half of the women excluded did not know menstrual dates or had already had a dating scan. Experimental intervention: (459 women randomised, 402 available for analysis).Early ultrasound examination between 10-12 weeks\\' gestation (but up to 18 weeks) to assess gestational age (using crownrump length (up to 13 weeks), biparietal diameter or femur length (after 13 weeks), number of fetuses, fetal viability and uterine or fetal abnormalities.337 of the women in the group received the scheduled routine ultrasound. Comparison intervention: (456 randomised, 413 available for analysis) Routine antenatal care with selective scan.96 women (23.9%) received a selected ultrasound scan between 10-18 weeks. Random sequence generation (selection bias) It was not clear how the randomisation sequence was generated, A system if blocks if 4 was used to assure a balanced distribution if patients in the screened and usual-care groups for each practice.It was not clear how many women were randomised at each of the participating clinics. Unclear risk Randomisation cards were placed in sequentially numbered sealed opaque envelopes.It was not clear if all envelopes were accounted for.The study used a Zelen post randomisation method and women decided to take part already knowing their assignment. High risk Participants would be aware of assignment at the point of treatment.Clinical sta would be aware of treatment allocation, which would affect clinical management and possibly other aspects of care. High risk Gestational age was calculated using (using crown-rump length (up to 13 weeks) or biparietal diameter or femur length (after 13 weeks) in the intervention group.The physicians were provided with the ultrasound results. High risk Of the 2171 screened patients 915 were eligible and had not exclusion criteria.Data were available for 815/915 randomised.337/402 in the experimental group had their scheduled ultrasound.96/413 in the control group had an indicated ultrasound scan between 10-18 weeks\\' gestation. Selective reporting (reporting bias) Trial not registered.Outcomes in the methods section fully reported. Ewigman 1990 (Continued) Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Other bias High risk There were protocol deviations with women not receiving the planned intervention.Baseline characteristics were similar although there were more nulliparous women in the intervention group (56.5%) vs controls (48.8%) and the number of twin pregnancies was greater in the control group. Methods Randomised controlled trial.Individual randomisation. Antenatal clinic and ultrasound unit within the area served by Tygerberg Hospital; a tertiary referral centre, South Africa. Inclusion criteria: women without risk factors for congenital anomalies referred for ultrasonography between 18 and 24 weeks\\' gestation.Women with uncertain dates of last menstrual period included. Exclusion criteria: women over 37 years of age, having had previous ultrasound in this pregnancy, women with increased risk of congenital abnormalities, diabetes mellitus or rhesus sensitisation. All outcomes Similar numbers of patients excluded in both groups for not pregnant or lost for follow up. Selective reporting (reporting bias) Trial not registered.Outcomes in the methods section fully reported. Other bias not identified. Cluster-randomised controlled trial. Multi-centre trial in 58 sites (clusters) in 5 countries: Pakistan (10), Kenya (12), Zambia (10), Democratic Republic of Congo ( 8), and Guatemala (18).Intervention and control clusters were stratified by country, and factors such as historic perinatal mortality rates and logistic factors such as travel time to Emergency Obstetric and Neonatal Care facilities were also taken into account.Each cluster was defined by a health centre and its catchment area with approximately 500 births per year.The 58 clusters (29 intervention and 29 control) were in mainly rural areas. Participants 46,904 women delivered in the cluster areas over the study period. Inclusion criteria: all pregnant women attending clinics able to give informed consent and living in the study cluster at or after 18 weeks\\' gestation. Exclusion criteria: women in labour Experimental intervention: (24,008 women in 29 clusters).This was a complex intervention involving training health workers (nurses, midwives and clinical officers) to perform ultrasound at 16-22 and 32-36 weeks\\' gestation.Women identified with complications were to be referred to hospital.There were also community sensitization activities to inform women of the ultrasound clinics.A further component of the intervention was training provided to sta in referral hospitals to provide care in major obstetric and neonatal emergencies (such as newborn resuscitation).Unclear risk \"lost-to-follow up rates similar between….groups\"There were discrepancies in the number of clusters and in some of the outcome data reported in the protocol and subsequent papers.These discrepancies were not explained. Selective reporting (reporting bias) The trial was registered and main objectives reported.Analyses took account of cluster design effect. There was some protocol deviation.In the intervention clusters 77.6% of women received at least one study ultrasound.There was considerable variation in different settings with regard to ultrasound use in control groups (95% in Pakistan vs < 5% in African countries). Other considerations: clusters were stratified by country and took account of baseline differences between settings.However, there was huge variation between cluster sites in terms of baseline mortality rates and maternity care provision and utilisation.Stillbirth rates ranged between 22 to 54 per 1000 and neonatal mortality between 16 to 45 per 1000 infants.Baseline caesarean section rates ranged from 0.1% in Democratic Republic Kongo to 11.4% in Guatemala.Birth location and birth attendant also varied considerably.Despite adjustment to take account of cluster design, these large variations between sites means that overall results are more difficult to interpret. Methods Randomised controlled trial.Individual randomisation. Participants 20 collaborating general practices and a district teaching hospital in the United Kingdom Inclusion criteria: women attending their GP practice, in the first trimester of pregnancy, no obstetric indication for a first trimester ultrasound examination. Exclusion criteria: indication for a first trimester scan Low risk Participating general practices were provided with a series of consecutively numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes randomised in blocks of six, which allocated the women to the \\'scan\\' or \\'no-scan\\' group. Blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias) All outcomes The estimated due date was recalculated if the scan dates differed by more than 5 days with the menstrual dates.The estimated due date was entered into the patient\\'s obstetric notes, and all subsequent management decisions were based on this assessment of gestational age. High risk Multiple gestations were disclosed as were suspected structural fetal anomalies with referral to the prenatal diagnosis unit.Nonviable or ectopic pregnancies were managed appropriately. Low risk 4 women in each group lost to follow up.9 women in scan arm had non trial scan; 21 in no scan arm had non trial scan Selective reporting (reporting bias) Trial was registered and expected outcomes were reported Other bias High risk Trial was stopped early.

Inclusion criteria: English speaking \"low-risk\" pregnant women who were aged 18 years or older.Last menstrual period known within 1 week.Gestational age < 18 weeks.No plans to change care provider. Exclusion criteria: previous ultrasonography during this pregnancy, previous stillbirth, irregular menstrual cycle, last menstrual period induced by an oral contraceptive agent, fertility-drug use in current cycle, discrepancy between size and dates > 3 weeks, previous small-for-gestational-age infant, diabetes mellitus, chronic hypertension, chronic renal disease, pelvic mass, fetal death, ectopic pregnancy, molar pregnancy, multiple gestation, planned termination of pregnancy, planned amniocentesis, planned cervical cerclage, planned ultrasonography for reasons other than screening Experimental intervention: (7812 randomised, 7617 analysed).Ultrasound examinations between 15-22 weeks and 31-35 weeks for placental location, amniotic-fluid volume, uterine and adnexal pathology, the number of fetuses, and sonographic biometry of the fetus (biparietal diameter, head circumference, abdominal circumference and femur length), as well as a detailed anatomical survey of the intracranial anatomy, spine, heart (4-chamber view), stomach, cord insertion, diaphragm, kidneys, bladder, and extremities of the fetus. Comparison intervention: (7718 randomised, 7534 analysed).Routine antenatal care with selective scan (i.e.only when it was ordered by a physician for medical reasons that developed after randomisation). The findings were reported to the woman\\'s physician. High risk Participants would be aware of assignment at the point of treatment.Clinical sta would be aware of treatment allocation, which would affect clinical management and possibly other aspects of care. Low risk \\'131 women in the screened group and 121 women in the control group were lost to follow up, primarily because of patient relocation\\'.The reasons for which women were lost to follow-up, and their frequency, were similar in the ultrasound-screening and control groups.In addition, the women lost to follow-up in the two groups were similar with respect to their base-line characteristics. Cochrane Library Trusted evidence All outcomes Low risk \"318 women did not attend ultrasound screening at the two study hospitals\" \"drop outs between randomisation and delivery were equally distributed between the groups\" \"4 women lost to follow up because of incomplete identification or moving abroad\" \"non-attenders were included and analyzed as part of the screening group\" Selective reporting (reporting bias) Study not prospectively registered.Pre-specified outcomes were antenatal use of medical services, rates of obstetric procedures, and fetal outcomes.

Study conducted in a district hospital (Dr Yusuf Dadoo Hospital) and regional referral hospitals (Leratong Hospital) in Western Gauteng, South Africa.These 2 hospitals serve a predominantly black working class population who depend on free state-funded maternity care facilities. Inclusion criteria: low-risk pregnancies at 18-23 weeks by clinical estimation who planned to deliver at either, of the two hospitals above.Women with uncertain menstrual history were included. Exclusion criteria: high-risk pregnancies, women who already had an ultrasound in this pregnancy. A cluster was defined as all eligible women presenting for prenatal care on a single day. Of 955 women enrolled, 151 (15.7%) were lost to follow up, leaving 804 for analysis All participants who presented on a certain day would be randomised in one cluster to either the intervention group or the control group.

To assess the e ect of routine pregnancy ultrasound before 24 weeks as part of a screening programme, compared to selective ultrasound or no ultrasound, on the early diagnosis of abnormal pregnancy location, termination for fetal congenital abnormality, multiple pregnancy, maternal outcomes and later fetal compromise. To assess the e ect of first trimester (before 14 weeks) and second trimester (14 to 24 weeks) ultrasound, separately. We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth\\'s Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov,and the World Health Organization\\'s International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) on 11 August 2020.We also examined the reference lists of retrieved studies. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, cluster-RCTs and RCTs published in abstract form.We included all trials with pregnant women who had routine or revealed ultrasound versus selective ultrasound, no ultrasound, or concealed ultrasound, before 24 weeks\\' gestation.All eligible studies were screened for scientific integrity and trustworthiness. Two review authors independently assessed trials for eligibility and risk of bias, extracted data and checked extracted data for accuracy.Two review authors independently used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome Our review included data from 13 RCTs including 85,265 women.The review included four comparisons.Four trials were assessed to be at low risk of bias for both sequence generation and allocation concealment and two as high risk.The nature of the intervention made it impossible to blind women and sta providing care to treatment allocation.Sample attrition was low in the majority of trials and outcome data were available for most women.Many trials were conducted before it was customary for trials to be registered and protocols published. First trimester routine versus selective ultrasound: four studies, 1791 women, from Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US). First trimester scans probably reduce short-term maternal anxiety about pregnancy (risk ratio (RR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.65 to 0.99; moderate-certainty evidence).We do not have information on whether the reduction was sustained. The evidence is very uncertain about the e ect of first trimester scans on perinatal loss (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.73 ; 648 participants; one study; low-certainty evidence) or induction of labour for post-maturity (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.37; 1474 participants; three studies; lowcertainty evidence). The e ect of routine first trimester ultrasound on birth before 34 weeks or termination of pregnancy for fetal abnormality was not reported. Second trimester routine versus selective ultrasound: seven studies, 36,053 women, from Finland, Norway, South Africa, Sweden and the US. Second trimester scans probably make little di erence to perinatal loss (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.20; 17,918 participants, three studies; moderate-certainty evidence) or intrauterine fetal death (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.42; 29,584 participants, three studies; low-certainty evidence). Second trimester scans may reduce induction of labour for post-maturity (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.73; 24,174 participants, six studies; lowcertainty evidence), presumably by more accurate dating. Routine second trimester ultrasound may improve detection of multiple pregnancy (RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.16; 274 participants, five studies; low-certainty evidence). Routine second trimester ultrasound may increase detection of major fetal abnormality before 24 weeks (RR 3.45, 95% CI 1.67 to 7.12; 387 participants, two studies; low-certainty evidence) and probably increases the number of women terminating pregnancy for major anomaly (RR 2.36, 95% CI 1.13 to 4.93; 26, 893 participants, four studies; moderate-certainty evidence). Long-term follow-up of children exposed to scans before birth did not indicate harm to children\\'s physical or intellectual development (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.34 ; 603 participants, one study; low-certainty evidence). The e ect of routine second trimester ultrasound on birth before 34 weeks or maternal anxiety was not reported. Standard care plus two ultrasounds and referral for complications versus standard care: one cluster-RCT, 47,431 women, from Democratic Republic of Congo, Guatemala, Kenya, Pakistan and Zambia. This trial included a co-intervention, training of healthcare workers and referral for complications and was, therefore, assessed separately. Standard pregnancy care plus two scans, and training and referral for complications, versus standard care probably makes little di erence to whether women with complications give birth in a risk appropriate setting with facilities for caesarean section (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.19; 11,680 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) .The intervention also probably makes little to no di erence to low birthweight (< 2500 g) (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.13; 47,312 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).The evidence is very uncertain about whether the community intervention (including ultrasound) makes any di erence to maternal mortality (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.55; 46,768 participants; low-certainty evidence) . Revealed ultrasound results (communicated to both patient and doctor) versus concealed ultrasound results (blinded to both patient and doctor at any time before 24 weeks): one study, 1095 women, from the UK. The evidence was very uncertain for all results relating to revealed versus concealed ultrasound scan (very low-certainty evidence). Early scans probably reduce short term maternal anxiety. Later scans may reduce labour induction for post-maturity.They may improve detection of major fetal abnormalities and increase the number of women who choose termination of pregnancy for this reason.They may also reduce the number of undetected twin pregnancies.All these findings accord with observational data. Neither type of scan appears to alter other important maternal or fetal outcomes, but our review may underestimate the e ect in modern practice because trials were mostly from relatively early in the development of the technology, and many control participants also had scans.The trials were also underpowered to show an e ect on other important maternal or fetal outcomes. Second trimester scans, at 14 to 24 weeks, increased detection of baby abnormalities, and more women chose termination of pregnancy for this reason.There was no evidence of an e ect on perinatal loss.Induction of labour to prevent the pregnancy going overdue was reduced. No studies reported how it a ected maternal anxiety.Multiple pregnancies were more likely to be detected by 24 weeks.Long-term followup of children exposed to these scans did not indicate that they were harmful to children\\'s physical or intellectual development. We also found one trial from a group of low and middle income countries, comparing a combination of two scans and specialist training of health professionals and referral of women with complications, with selective scans and routine care.The intervention did not alter the number of women delivering in a hospital with caesarean section facility.Nor did it appear to reduce maternal deaths or the numbers of low-birthweight babies, although the evidence was very uncertain. We also found one trial where all women underwent scans but the results were revealed to the health care professionals in half the cases.This trial showed no important e ect of revealing the scan results but the evidence was very uncertain. Most studies were carried out relatively early in the development of scan technology and when training in its use was less advanced.In most trials a large proportion of women in the control groups received a scan too. Early scans probably reduce maternal worries about the baby in the short term.Later scans may reduce labour induction to prevent the pregnancy going overdue.They may also improve detection of major abnormalities in the baby and increase the number of women who choose pregnancy termination for this reason.They may also reduce the number of undetected twin pregnancies.All these findings accord with common sense. Although neither type of scan appears to alter other important outcomes, our review may underestimate the e ect in modern practice because the trials were mostly from relatively early in the development of scan technology, and many participants in the control arms also had scans. Diagnostic ultrasound examination may be employed at various time points in pregnancy, o en in the first or second trimester of pregnancy.It may be done routinely as a screening test or selectively to investigate a suspected clinical problem.The assumption underlying routine ultrasound in all pregnancies is that it will enable earlier detection of potential problems and improve management of pregnancy complications.Conversely, the risks are that false positive results will do harm.The focus of this review is to measure the e ect of routine ultrasound examination performed before 24 completed weeks\\' gestation to that of selective or no ultrasound examination. Early pregnancy ultrasound examination might result in the earlier detection of abnormal pregnancy location, pregnancy viability, fetal structural abnormalities, molar pregnancy, multiple pregnancy and more accurate dating (Chen 2019; García Fernández 2019; Peek 1994) .Early detection of ectopic pregnancy may allow earlier and safer treatment.Early detection of fetal abnormality might o er opportunities for pregnancy termination, or occasionally other treatment.More accurate dating and early detection of multiple pregnancy, or abnormally invasive placentas, may also allow improved management later in the pregnancy (Peek 1994) .However, the examination may cause parental anxiety and false positive diagnoses may lead to iatrogenic harm (Barnett 2002; Salvesen 1995) . We included studies that compared routine ultrasound as a screening tool to selective ultrasound or no ultrasound.We included any ultrasound scan intended to be done before 24 weeks\\' gestation.Selective ultrasound is any clinician-initiated ultrasound that is not part of the patient\\'s routine care.Selective ultrasound examination may have been employed in a variety of specific circumstances during pregnancy; for example, if a woman presented with bleeding in early pregnancy or where the fetus was perceived to be at particularly high risk of malformation.We assessed both ultrasound in the first trimester (before 14 weeks) and in the second trimester (before 24 weeks). The focus of this review is routine ultrasound before 24 weeks\\' gestation; late pregnancy screening a er 24 weeks\\' gestation has been addressed in another Cochrane Review (Bricker 2015) . Ultrasound screening before 24 weeks\\' gestation could lead to earlier detection of pregnancy-related problems and thus allow improved management of these conditions (Glanc 2018; Peek 1994) . Many pregnant women appreciate seeing their baby on ultrasound. However, the diagnosis of potential fetal abnormalities may cause anxiety.It is therefore important to consider women\\'s satisfaction in having an ultrasound examination performed (Hofmeyr 2009) . Routine ultrasound before 24 weeks, especially in the first trimester, may improve the accuracy of pregnancy dating and thereby a ect the number of pregnancies undergoing induction for post-maturity (Middleton 2018). Routine ultrasound before 24 weeks\\' gestation may improve detection of placental problems, placenta praevia, placenta accreta and vasa praevia.Early detection of these high-risk pregnancies may improve clinical management (Panaiotova 2019). Early detection of multiple pregnancy may help pregnancy and birth planning in many ways.Early determination of chorionicity and amnionicity helps to detect pregnancies at highest risk for complications, allowing for early expert referral (Lee 2006) . For most fetal abnormalities, the gain from early and correct detection will be mediated by allowing women choices on pregnancy termination, and there are a few abnormalities where in utero treatment may be o ered (Chen 2019; García Fernández 2019) . The use of routine pregnancy ultrasound needs to be considered in the context of potential hazards and limited resources. Implementing routine ultrasound should be based on evidence of benefit.Will the information that clinicians can obtain from routine ultrasound alter their management and thus improve the pregnancy outcome?In addition, the psychological e ect of ultrasound examinations on pregnant women is important to consider.This may be either negative (for instance, anxiety following false-positive identification of fetal abnormality) or positive (for example, reduced anxiety). To assess the e ect of routine pregnancy ultrasound before 24 weeks as part of a screening programme, compared to selective ultrasound or no ultrasound, on the early diagnosis of abnormal pregnancy location, termination for fetal congenital abnormality, multiple pregnancy, maternal outcomes and later fetal compromise. To assess the e ect of first trimester (before 14 weeks) and second trimester (14 to 24 weeks) ultrasound, separately. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, cluster-RCTs.RCTs published only in abstract form were eligible if su icient information was available to assess eligibility and risk of bias.Cross-over studies were excluded. Pregnant women, before 24 weeks\\' gestation. Eligible interventions were routine or revealed ultrasound screening versus selective ultrasound, or concealed ultrasound or no ultrasound for both the \\'first trimester\\' and \\'second trimester\\' of pregnancy.Revealed ultrasound means that results are communicated to both patient and doctor and concealed ultrasound means that the results are blinded to both patient and doctor.We included studies with ultrasound examinations at any time before 24 weeks. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. We defined \\'first trimester\\' as earlier than 14 weeks.We defined \\'second trimester\\' as 14 weeks or later. 1. Maternal anxiety 2. Perinatal loss (defined as miscarriage, termination of pregnancy or intrauterine death a er trial entry, or death of a liveborn infant up to 28 days of age or before discharge from hospital). As requested by the World Health Organization (WHO), we have added the following non-prespecified similar outcomes: Perinatal death (fetal death a er 24 completed weeks gestation and before six completed days of life), perinatal death, excluding those because of lethal malformations, miscarriage (fetal loss before 20 weeks). Diagnoses of the following conditions The following methods section of this review is based on a standard template used by Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth. We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth\\'s Trials Register by contacting their Information Specialist (11 August 2020).Search results are screened by two people and the full text of all relevant trial reports identified through the searching activities described above is reviewed.Based on the intervention described, each trial report is assigned a number that corresponds to a specific Pregnancy and Childbirth review topic (or topics), and is then added to the Register.The Information Specialist searches the Register for each review using this topic number rather than keywords.This results in a more specific search set that will be fully accounted for in the relevant review sections (Included studies, Excluded studies, Studies awaiting classification or Ongoing studies). Using the search methods detailed in Appendix 1. we also searched ClinicalTrials.govand the available databases that contribute to the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (11 August 2020) for unpublished, planned and ongoing trial reports. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. We also searched the reference lists of retrieved studies. We did not apply any language or date restrictions Two review authors independently assessed for inclusion all the potential studies we identified as a result of the search strategy.We resolved any disagreement through discussion or, if required, we consulted a third senior review author. We created a study flow diagram to map out the number of records identified, included and excluded: Figure 1 . All studies meeting our inclusion criteria were also evaluated by two review authors against predefined criteria to select studies that were deemed to be su iciently trustworthy to be included in the analysis, based on available information. • No prospective trial registration for studies published a er 2010 without plausible explanation • When requested, trial authors refuse to provide/share the protocol and/or ethics approval letter • Implausible results (e.g.massive risk reduction for main outcomes with small sample size) • Unexpectedly even numbers of women \\'randomised\\' including a mismatch between the numbers and the methods, e.g. if they say no blocking was used but still end up with equal numbers, or they say they used blocks of four but the final numbers di er by six. Studies assessed as being potentially \\'high risk\\' would not be included in the review.Where a study was classified as \\'high risk\\' for one or more of the above criteria, we planned to contact the study authors to address any possible lack of information or concerns.If adequate information remained unavailable, the study would remain in \\'Studies awaiting classification\\' and the concerns and communications with the author (or lack of communication) described. Data from abstracts would only be included if, in addition to the trustworthiness assessment, the study authors confirmed in writing that the data to be included in the review had come from the final analysis and would not change.If such information was not available or not provided, we planned that the study would remain in \\'Studies awaiting classification\\'. We designed a form to extract data.For eligible studies, at least two review authors extracted the data using the agreed form.We resolved discrepancies through discussion, or, if required, through consultation with a third review author.We entered data into Review Manager 5 so ware (RevMan 2014) and checked these data for accuracy.When information regarding any of the above was unclear, we attempted to contact authors of the original reports to obtain further details. Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011) .We resolved any disagreement by discussion or by involving a third review author. For cluster-randomised trials, we paid particular attention to the following risk of bias: recruitment bias; baseline imbalance; loss of clusters; incorrect analysis; and comparability with individually randomised trials, as outlined in the Cochrane Handbook section 16. 3.2 and 16.4.3 (Higgins 2011) .For individually randomised trials, we assessed the following domains or risk of bias. ( We have described for each included study the method used to generate the allocation sequence in su icient detail to allow an assessment of whether it should produce comparable groups. We assessed the method as: • low risk of bias (any truly random process, e.g.random number table; computer random number generator); • high risk of bias (any non-random process, e.g.odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number); • unclear risk of bias. ( We have described for each included study the method used to conceal allocation to interventions prior to assignment and will assess whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during recruitment, or changed a er assignment. We assessed the methods as: • low risk of bias (e.g.telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes); • high risk of bias (open random allocation; unsealed or nonopaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth); • unclear risk of bias. Achieving e ective blinding for an intervention such as ultrasound is di icult, however, we have described for each included study any attempt to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received.We considered that studies were at low risk of bias if they were blinded, or if we judged that the lack of blinding would be unlikely to a ect results.We assessed blinding separately for di erent outcomes or classes of outcomes. We assessed the methods as: • low, high or unclear risk of bias for participants; • low, high or unclear risk of bias for personnel. For use in our GRADE assessment of the certainty of evidence, we have defined the term \\'process outcome\\'.We defined a \\'process outcome\\' as a variable that is part of the care pathway that is being guided (and altered) by the ultrasound result.The intervention in a \\'process outcomes\\' is not only the test (ultrasound) but patient management guided by test result (ultrasound finding); therefore, lack of blinding does not apply as a reason to downgrade.However, all other criteria for the assessment of the certainty of evidence still apply. The following are the process outcomes, for which lack of blinding does not apply as a reason to downgrade: • birth in a risk-appropriate setting; • number of fetal ultrasound scans; • number of antenatal visits; • antenatal hospital admission (WHO-requested outcome); • antenatal care utilisation (four or more visits) (WHO-requested outcome); • induction of labour for post-maturity; • termination of pregnancy for major anomaly; • appropriately timed serum screening tests (WHO-requested outcome); • appropriately timed anomaly scan (18 to 22 weeks) (WHOrequested outcome). Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews We have described for each included study the methods used, if any, to blind outcome assessors from knowledge of which intervention a participant received.We assessed blinding separately for di erent outcomes or classes of outcomes. We assessed methods used to blind outcome assessment as: • low, high or unclear risk of bias. For use in our GRADE assessment of the certainty of evidence, we have defined the term \\'process outcome\\'.We defined a \\'process outcome\\' as a variable that is part of the care pathway that is being guided (and altered) by the ultrasound result.The intervention in a \\'process outcomes\\' is not only the test (ultrasound) but patient management guided by test result (ultrasound finding); therefore, lack of blinding does not apply as a reason to downgrade.However, all other criteria for the assessment of the certainty of evidence still apply.

We have described for each included study, and for each outcome or class of outcomes, the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis.We have stated whether attrition and exclusions were reported and the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes.Where su icient information was reported, or supplied by the trial authors, we planned to re-include missing data in the analyses. We assessed methods as: • low risk of bias (e.g.no missing outcome data; missing outcome data balanced across groups); • high risk of bias (e.g.numbers or reasons for missing data imbalanced across groups; \\'as treated\\' analysis done with substantial departure of intervention received from that assigned at randomisation); • unclear risk of bias. We used a cut-o point of 10% to specify the level of missing data used to assess that a study was at low risk of bias. We have described for each included study how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We assessed the methods as: • low risk of bias (where it is clear that all of the study\\'s prespecified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported); • high risk of bias (where not all the study\\'s pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported); or the study was not registered.• unclear risk of bias. We have described for each included study any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias. Concerns about bias could include for example, was there a potential source of bias related to the specific study design?Was the trial stopped early due to some data-dependent process?Was there extreme baseline imbalance?Has the study been claimed to be fraudulent? We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias: • low risk of other bias; • high risk of other bias; • unclear whether there is risk of other bias. We made explicit judgements about whether studies were at high risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the Handbook (Higgins 2011) .With reference to (1) to ( 6) above, we assessed the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and whether we considered it was likely to impact on the findings. Where data were available we combined results from studies in meta-analysis. For dichotomous data, we have presented results as summary risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous data, we used the mean di erence (MD) if outcomes were measured in the same way between trials.We planned to use the standardised mean di erence (SMD) to combine trials that measured the same outcome, but used di erent methods.We applied the following assessment to the data before inclusion in a meta-analysis: for scale-derived continuous data, SDs and means Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews would have to be available; Otherwise, we did not include such data in meta-analysis, but instead have presented them in the text. We included a cluster-randomised trial in the analyses.We had planned to adjust results from such trials using the methods described in the Handbook using an estimate of the intracluster correlation co-e icient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), from a similar trial or from a study of a similar population.However, the trial authors of the included trial presented data that had already been adjusted for cluster design e ect, and as recommended we used this adjusted data in our analyses.We considered that the intervention in the cluster trial (including training of healthcare sta and broader community activities) meant that it was not appropriate to combine it with other studies in meta-analysis. If, in the future, we identify further cluster trials we plan to synthesise the relevant information.We will consider it reasonable to combine the results from both individual and clusterrandomised trials if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs, and the interaction between the e ect of intervention and the choice of randomisation unit is considered to be unlikely. We will also acknowledge heterogeneity in the randomisation unit and perform an analysis to investigate the e ects of the randomisation unit. For included studies, we have noted levels of attrition.We had planned to explore the impact of including studies with high levels of missing data in the overall assessment of treatment e ect by using sensitivity analysis, however, attrition in the included studies was relatively low. For all outcomes, we carried out analyses, as far as possible, on an intention-to-treat basis, i.e. we attempted to include all participants randomised to each group in the analyses, with all participants analysed in the group to which they were allocated, regardless of whether or not they received the allocated intervention.The denominator for each outcome in each trial is the number randomised minus any participants whose outcomes are known to be missing. For dichotomous outcome data, when synthesizing undesirable outcomes, such as mortality or adverse events, we assumed the event rate of a given outcome is the same in the missing population as it is in the completer population and planned therefore calculate the rate of an event in the completer population and apply it to the missing population to obtain the assumed number of event for intention-to-treat analysis.In the event we did not carry out this planned analyses as the number of deaths and serious adverse events were very similar in the control and intervention groups and overall sample loss was low.We did not apply this missing data assumption to desirable outcomes or to continuous outcome data.If missing data were greater than 10% in a trial, we planned to perform sensitivity analysis. We assessed statistical heterogeneity in each meta-analysis using the Tau , I and Chi statistics.We regarded heterogeneity as substantial if I was greater than 30% and either Tau was greater than zero, or there was a low P value (less than 0.10) in the Chi test for heterogeneity. If there were 10 or more studies in the meta-analysis we planned to investigate reporting biases (such as publication bias) using funnel plots.We would assess funnel plot asymmetry visually and if asymmetry was suggested by a visual assessment, we would perform exploratory analyses to investigate it.In this version of the review none of the meta-analyses included 10 or more trials. We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager 5 so ware (RevMan 2014).We used fixed-e ect meta-analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies are estimating the same underlying treatment e ect: i.e.where trials are examining the same intervention, and the trials\\' populations and methods are judged su iciently similar.If there was clinical heterogeneity su icient to expect that the underlying treatment e ects would di er between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we used a random-e ects metaanalysis to produce an overall summary provided an average treatment e ect across trials was considered clinically meaningful.The random-e ects summary has been treated as the average of the range of possible treatment e ects and we have discussed the clinical implications of treatment e ects di ering between trials.If the average treatment e ect was not considered clinically meaningful we planned not to combine trials. When we used random-e ects analyses, the results have been presented as the average treatment e ect with 95% CIs, and the estimates of Tau and I . We did not plan to carry out subgroup analysis. We planned to carry out sensitivity analysis to explore the e ect of trial quality assessed by random sequence generation and allocation concealment, high attrition rate (10%), or both, with poor-quality studies being excluded from the analyses in order to assess whether this makes any di erence to the overall result.We did not carry out this planned further analysis as overall attrition rate was very low.Overall attrition was fairly low and we considered that only one study was at high risk of bias for randomisation and this study contributed few data, so we did not consider that further analysis would throw any more light on results. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach as outlined in the GRADE handbook in order to assess the certainty of the body of evidence relating to the following outcomes: Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2. Perinatal loss (defined as miscarriage including termination of pregnancy or intrauterine death a er trial entry, or death of a liveborn infant up to 28 days of age or before discharge from hospital) 3. Termination for major abnormality 4. Induction of labour rate for post-maturity 5. Birth before 34 weeks\\' gestation. GRADEpro Guideline Development Tool was used to import data from Review Manager 5.3 (RevMan 2014) in order to create \\'Summary of findings\\' tables.A summary of the intervention e ect and a measure of certainty for each of the above outcomes was produced using the GRADE approach.The GRADE approach uses five considerations (study limitations, consistency of e ect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the certainty of the body of evidence for each outcome.With RCT data, evidence can be downgraded from \\'high certainty\\' by one level for serious (or by two levels for very serious) limitations, depending on assessments for risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of e ect estimates or potential publication bias.Summary of findings for the main comparison can be found in Summary of findings 1. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. The literature search identified 85 relevant papers reporting findings from 32 trials examining ultrasound for fetal assessment before 24 weeks of pregnancy.Trials included 140,417 women.Most studies resulted in several publications or reports.A total of 13 randomised trials (53 reports) were eligible for inclusion in the review. We have included data from 12 RCTs including 37,842 women, along with one large cluster-randomised trial that included an additional 47,421 deliveries (Goldenberg 2018) . Three trials (six reports) had no published data (Belanger 1996; Snaith 2004; Wald 1988) .We contacted the authors of these studies and assigned these records to Studies awaiting classification.We added three new trials (six reports) to Ongoing studies a er we contacted the authors (Figueras 2017; Pietersma 2018; Richter 2020).We excluded a further 13 studies (20 reports). From the 13 studies included in this review, three did not meet our criteria for trustworthiness, for the following reasons. • We were unsuccessful in our attempt to contact the authors of two studies.Two studies were published only as abstracts and we have not been able to confirm with the trial authors that the data were from the final analyses (Belanger 1996 , Snaith 2004 ).• For one study, only the trial registration was published, and we were not able to obtain study data from the final analyses from the authors (Wald 1988).Wald 1988, also did not respond to requests to the authors of the previous Cochrane Review (Whitworth 2015); to date, no results of this study are available. In all cases, we made every e ort to contact the study authors.See Studies awaiting classification. All of the trials included an intervention involving an ultrasound examination before 24 weeks of pregnancy.The dates of the scans, and the number of scans women received, varied in di erent trials.In the Crowther 1999 trial, women were randomised either to routine ultrasound at their first visit or routine care.Both groups completed a questionnaire at the end of the first antenatal visit on their feelings about the pregnancy and their anxiety levels, which were measured on a Likert scale.The Likert scale was used to assess how \\'worried\\', \\'relaxed\\' and \\'excited\\' the women felt about their pregnancies.Responses to these questions could range from \\'not at all\\' to \\'very\\'.Crowther 1999 recruited participants between 1991 and 1995.Information on funding sources or declarations of interest were not reported. Early ultrasound examination between 10 and 12 weeks\\' gestation (but up to 18 weeks) versus routine care with selective scan was the design of the Ewigman 1990 trial, which Similarly, in all included studies, women in the intervention group were o ered a \\'routine\\' scan, whilst those in the control groups received a scan at the discretion of the clinical sta (\\'selective scans\\').Ultrasound scans in the intervention group may have been the only \\'routine\\' scan o ered, or it may have been an additional scan, with women in both intervention and control groups having scans scheduled at a later stage of pregnancy. Routine ultrasound screening at 15 weeks versus selective scan was the trial design of Waldenstrom 1988, which  Sample sizes varied in trials, from 218 in a trial in Canada (Bennett 2004 ) to 15,151 women in a US trial (RADIUS 1993) .There was also a large multi-country cluster trial, with 47,431 births during the study period (Goldenberg 2018) . The earliest trials recruited women in the late 1970s and early 1980s (Bakketeig 1984; Bennett 1982; Eik-Nes 1984; Salvesen 1993a) .Trials were mainly conducted in high-resource settings including Australia (Crowther 1999) , Canada (Bennett 2004 ), Finland (Saari-Kemppainen 1994) , Norway (Bakketeig 1984; Eik-Nes 1984) , Sweden (Waldenstrom 1988) , UK (Bennett 1982; Harrington 2006 ) and USA (Ewigman 1990; RADIUS 1993) ; two trials were carried out in a middle-income country, namely South Africa (Geerts 1996; van Dyk 2007) .The large cluster trial recruited women between 2014 and 2016 and was conducted in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Guatemala, Kenya, Pakistan and Zambia (Goldenberg 2018) . All trials recruited pregnant women.Most women able to give consent were eligible for inclusion.Depending on the time of the intervention women were recruited as early as eight weeks\\' gestation and up to 24 weeks. Eligible comparisons included: first trimester routine scan versus selective or no scan; second trimester routine scan versus no scan; and revealed ultrasound results (communicated to both patient and doctor) versus concealed ultrasound results (blinded to both patient and doctor) at any time before 24 weeks. As in all trials women in the control group received an ultrasound if clinically indicated, there was no true \\'no scan\\' control group. Furthermore, there was one trial that took place in low-andmiddle income countries and not only included a routine scan in the intervention group, but also a co-intervention of training of healthcare workers and a referral for complications, we have added this trial to its own comparison.Therefore, the types of interventions covered in this review are: 1. First trimester routine scan versus selective scan; 2. Second trimester routine scan versus selective scan; 3. Standard care plus two ultrasounds, and co-intervention of training of healthcare workers and referral for complications versus standard care with selective scan; 4. Revealed (ultrasound results communicated to both patient and doctor) versus concealed (ultrasound results blinded to both doctor and patient) scan at any time before 24 weeks. We defined \\'first trimester\\' as earlier than 14 weeks.We defined \\'second trimester\\' as 14 weeks or later. Apart from the trial of revealed versus concealed results (Bennett 1982) , women in trials were randomised to receive a routine scan versus no routine scan.This is not to say that women in comparison groups were denied scans.The control condition was usually \"selective\" scans or scans as \"clinically indicated\" (requested by doctors).This meant that in most trials a proportion of women in the control group, and sometimes a large proportion, also received scans.Further, trials frequently focused on evaluating an additional scan; for example, an early dating scan.However, in addition a later fetal anomaly scan would be o ered to women in both intervention and control groups.For this reason, our comparisons are between women receiving an intervention scan versus a selective scan, rather than no scan.We have described in the Characteristics of included studies tables the control conditions and (where this was reported) the number of women in control groups receiving selective scans.In three of the trials included in the second trimester comparison, women in the intervention group were also o ered trial scans in the third trimester (at approximately 32 weeks) (Bakketeig 1984; Eik-Nes 1984; RADIUS 1993) . Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. The aims of scans varied across trials and several of our prespecified outcomes were not well-reported in trials.Our primary outcomes, overall fetal and perinatal loss, were not reported in the same way in all trials; dates and reasons for loss were not always apparent.In our results section we have reported both overall fetal and perinatal loss and where data was available, we have reported data for separate categories of loss (termination of pregnancy, miscarriage, stillbirth and neonatal death).Very little information was available on our second primary outcome: maternal anxiety, and we have no data from these trials on whether scans are associated with any longer-term impact on maternal psychological well-being. We have reported results for several outcomes we had not prespecified in the protocol.Findings from the review will be included in a WHO guideline on antenatal care, and WHO report on several key outcomes including for example low infant birthweight (< 2500 g) and small-for-gestational-age infant.We have therefore reported on these outcomes if data were available; but have indicated that these were not pre-specified. We excluded 13 studies (Chen 2008; Du 1993; Hoglund Carlsson 2016; Larsen 1992; Leung 2006; Nelson 2017; Owen 1994; Rustico 2005; Saltvedt 2006; Schifano 2010; Schwarzler 1999; Votino 2012; Zhang 2018 ). In the Chen 2008 and the Votino 2012 trials, all participants (in both the intervention and control groups) received early ultrasound scans.In the four studies by Hoglund Carlsson 2016; Saltvedt 2006; Schwarzler 1999; and Zhang 2018, the timing of scans was examined (i.e. earlier versus later scans). In the Du 1993 trial, all participants (in both the intervention and control groups) received an early scan and women in the intervention group had an additional scan in the third trimester. In Larsen 1992, all participants (in both the intervention and control groups) received early scans and both groups received serial ultrasound scans from 28 weeks.Both groups received scans in the third trimester in the Nelson 2017 trial.Owen 1994 looked at women with a high risk of fetal anomaly, with women in the intervention group receiving more frequent scans. Three trials compared two versus three or four dimensional ultrasound scans (Leung 2006; Rustico 2005; Schifano 2010 ). Please find details in Figure 3 and Figure 4 . Four of the included trials were assessed to be at low risk of bias for both sequence generation and allocation concealment (Bennett 2004; Crowther 1999; Goldenberg 2018; Harrington 2006) .Two studies were assessed as being at high risk of bias (Bennett 1982; van Dyk 2007) for both sequence generation and allocation concealment.For the rest, studies did not describe methods fully and were therefore assessed as unclear for at least one of the two domains relating to allocation. The nature of the intervention meant that it was not possible to adequately blind women and sta providing care to treatment allocation.In one study (Bennett 1982) women were randomised to revealed/concealed results; thus, all women had scans, and may not have been aware of the randomisation group.However, even in this study, sta providing care would have been aware of whether or not scan results were in women\\'s maternity case notes.In the remaining studies, women who had scans would have been fully aware of the intervention, and women in control groups aware that they had not had scans.Whether or not women had scans might impact on women\\'s behaviour and on the behaviour of sta providing care (for example, requests for additional tests or interventions).The impact of lack of blinding on outcomes was not simple to assess but all studies were assessed as being at high or unclear risk of bias for blinding. Sample attrition was mainly low in these trials and outcome data were available for most women recruited.In two studies there was sample loss, or loss was not balanced across groups (Bakketeig 1984; Ewigman 1990 ); we assessed these to be at high risk of bias.In another study, there was insu icient information on sample attrition or missing data, and this study was assessed to be at unclear risk of bias for this domain (Goldenberg 2018) . Many of these trials were conducted before it was customary for all trials to be registered and for protocols to be published before studies commenced.Four studies were assessed as high risk of bias for this domain, but this was mainly due to lack of information (Bennett 1982; Bennett 2004; RADIUS 1993; Saari-Kemppainen 1994) . We assessed that five trials were at high risk of bias for other sources of bias.The Harrington 2006 trial was stopped early.In other trials (Bennett 1982; Ewigman 1990; RADIUS 1993; Saari-Kemppainen 1994) there were other factors that meant results were more di icult to interpret.Protocol deviation was a particular issue in these studies, with large proportions of women in the control groups undergoing scans and, or women in the intervention group not attending for trial interventions. In the Goldenberg 2018 trial, the authors made adjustments for design e ect; the adjusted numbers were used whenever possible for the purposes of the review.There was some protocol deviation.In the intervention clusters, 77.6% of women received at least one study ultrasound.There was considerable variation in di erent settings with regard to ultrasound use in control groups (95% in Pakistan versus less than 5% in African countries). Other considerations: clusters were stratified by country and took account of baseline di erences among settings.However, there was huge variation among cluster sites in terms of baseline mortality rates and maternity care provision and utilisation.Stillbirth rates ranged between 22 to 54 per 1000 and neonatal mortality between 16 to 45 per 1000 infants.Baseline caesarean section rates ranged from 0.1% in Democratic Republic of Congo to 11.4% in Guatemala.Birth location and birth attendant also varied considerably.Despite adjustment to take account of cluster design, these large variations among sites means that overall results are more di icult to interpret. In the van Dyk 2007trial, all participants who presented on a certain day would be randomised to either the intervention group or the control group.On some days, women were randomised to ultrasound scanning, and some days to routine care.In the control routine care group, 21.9% of women received an ultrasound scan for clinical reasons; therefore, we decided to include the trial in the routine versus selective ultrasound comparison.There was no adjustment for any possible variation on di erent days.The analysis of the results was at the level of individual women. See: Summary of findings 1 First trimester routine compared to selective ultrasound for fetal assessment before 24 weeks\\' gestation; Summary of findings 2 Second trimester routine versus selective ultrasound for fetal assessment before 24 weeks\\' gestation Four studies contributed to this comparison (Bennett 2004; Crowther 1999; Ewigman 1990; Harrington 2006) . This outcome was reported in one trial (Crowther 1999) , which included 648 women with 634 women completing an anxiety questionnaire at the end of their first antenatal visit.The evidence suggests that women undergoing routine first trimester scans are probably less worried about their pregnancy a er the scan (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.99; 634 participants, one study; moderate-certainty evidence, downgraded due to study design limitations).However, women had no long-term follow-up, and it is not clear whether this e ect was sustained throughout pregnancy (Analysis 1.1). One trial (Crowther 1999 ) reported perinatal loss.The evidence is very uncertain about the e ect of first trimester scans on pregnancy loss between screened and unscreened groups, giving a di erence of 0.65% versus 0.67%, respectively, because the 95% CI is compatible with a wide range of e ects that encompass both appreciable benefit and also harm (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.73 ; 648 participants, one study; low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to study design limitations and imprecision) (Analysis 1.2).When assessing only perinatal death, the results were very uncertain Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for women undergoing routine scans compared with controls (perinatal death is defined as fetal death a er 24 completed weeks gestation and before six completed days of life).The unweighted di erence was 0.07% versus 0.09%, respectively (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.23 to 2.31; 1472 participants, two studies; very low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to a low event rate and imprecision) (Analysis 1.3).Even when excluding lethal abnormalities, compared with controls, there was not enough evidence that first trimester routine scans made any di erence in perinatal death (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.82; 824 participants, one study) (Analysis 1.4).For miscarriage before 20 weeks, there may be little to no di erence between the groups (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.24; 1111 participants, two studies; low-certainty evidence, downgraded for imprecision due to a low event rate and wide 95% CI crossing the line of no e ect) (Analysis 1.5). One study (Harrington 2006) with 463 women reported one IUFD in the routine scan group as compared to none in the selective scan group.The evidence is very uncertain about the e ect of first trimester routine scan on the occurrence of IUFD (RR 2.96, 95% CI 0.12 to 72.32; 463 participants, one study; low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to study design limitations and imprecision.Imprecision was due to a low event rate and wide 95% CI crossing the line of no e ect) ( Analysis 1.6). There was only one study comparing first trimester routine scan to selective scan regarding detecting multiple pregnancy before 24 to 26 weeks\\' gestation.Both sets of twins were detected in the screening group, whereas only five out of seven sets of twins (71%) were detected in the selective scan group (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.03 to 8.19; nine multiple pregnancies, one study; low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to study design limitations and imprecision.Imprecision was due to a low event rate and sample size and wide 95% CI crossing the line of no e ect) (Analysis 1.7).The same study also assessed diagnosis of twins a er the onset of labour.Both sets of twins were diagnosed before labour in the screening group, and six out of seven sets of twins (85%) were identified before labour in the control group (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.05 to 16.36; nine multiple pregnancies, one study; low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to study design limitations and imprecision.Imprecision was due to a low event rate, small sample size and wide 95% CI crossing the line of no e ect) (Analysis 1.8). One study reported detection of ectopic pregnancy prior to clinical presentation (suspected and confirmed by either surgical and/or medical treatment and/or histopathology).There was insu icient evidence to determine whether first trimester scans make any di erence in diagnosing ectopic pregnancy before clinical presentation.There was a single ectopic pregnancy in the screened group that was detected before clinical presentation and no ectopic pregnancies in the control group (RR 2.74, 95% CI 0.11 to 66.51; 218 participants, one study; very low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to study design limitations and imprecision.Imprecision was due to a low event rate, small sample size and wide 95% CI crossing the line of no e ect) ( Analysis 1.9). The evidence is very uncertain about the e ect of a routine first trimester ultrasound on the number of women undergoing birth by caesarean section due to wide CIs (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.61; 1253 participants, three studies; low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to study design limitations and imprecision) (Analysis 1.10). The evidence is very uncertain about the e ect of a routine first trimester scan on the number of inductions of labour for postmaturity pregnancy (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.37; 1474 participants, three studies; low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to study design limitations and imprecision) (Analysis 1.11), or inductions of labour for any reason (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.09; 463 participants, one study; low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to study design limitations and imprecision) (Analysis 1.12). The evidence is very uncertain on whether a first trimester scan makes any di erence to the number of women undergoing termination for any cause (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.14 to 6.95; 463 participants, one study; very low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to study design limitations and very serious imprecision) (Analysis 1.13).There are no data to assess whether first trimester ultrasound made a di erence in a woman\\'s choice to terminate for major abnormality. One study reported on first trimester screening and appropriately timed serum screening.The evidence is very uncertain about the e ect of a first trimester routine scan on the number of women requiring repeat serum screening (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.76; 602 participants, one study) (Analysis 1.14). A first trimester routine scan may make little to no di erence to the number of women not having an appropriately timed detailed ultrasound examination (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.08; 602 participants, one study) (Analysis 1.15). One study reported that a first trimester scan may make little to no di erence to serious neonatal morbidity (composite outcome including hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy, intraventricular haemorrhage, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotising enterocolitis) (Ewigman 1990 ) (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.39; 824 participants, one study; low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to study design limitations and imprecision) ( Analysis 1.16). The evidence is very uncertain about the e ect of first trimester scan on low infant birthweight (less than 2500 g) (RR 2.01, 95% CI 0.99 to 4.08; 594 participants, one study; low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to study design limitations and imprecision) (Analysis 1.17). Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. The following outcomes were not reported in the studies in this comparison.Eight studies contributed to this comparison (Bakketeig 1984; Eik-Nes 1984; Geerts 1996; RADIUS 1993; Saari-Kemppainen 1994; van Dyk 2007; Waldenstrom 1988; Goldenberg 2018 ).However one trial, Goldenberg 2018, involved a co-intervention of training sonographers and referral for complications and was the only trial in low-and middle-income countries; therefore, this trial was analysed separately in Comparison 3. This outcome was not reported in any of the trials. Intrauterine fetal death (all fetal losses at or a er 20 weeks\\' gestation) Four studies reported on IUFD and show little to no di erence in the routine scan group versus selective scan (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.42; 29,584 participants, three studies; low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to study design limitations and imprecision. Imprecision was due to a low event rate and wide 95% CI crossing the line of no e ect) (Analysis 2.5). Routine second trimester ultrasound may reduce non-detection of multiple pregnancy before 24 to 26 weeks\\' gestation (RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.16; 274 participants, five studies; low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to study limitations) (Analysis 2.6). There is little evidence that routine second trimester ultrasound makes a di erence in the detection of multiple pregnancy before labour (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.74; 135 participants, three studies) (Analysis 2.7). One trial carried out in South Africa presented data on the mean number of ultrasound scans (Geerts 1996) .Selective ultrasound resulted in a lower mean number of ultrasound scans as compared to routine ultrasound.In this study, women in the routine ultrasound group had an average of 1.2 scans compared with an average of 0. There was little to no evidence of a di erence in number of antenatal hospital admissions between the routine ultrasound group and controls (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.27; 16,836 participants, five studies) and the mean number of antenatal visits (MD 0.08, 95% CI -0.30 to 0.46; 10,306 participants, three studies) was similar in both groups (Analysis 2.10; Analysis 2.9).A trial in South Africa reported a mean number of hospital visits, which was 5.8 +/-1.8 in the screening group versus 5.9 +/-2.0 in the selective scan group (van Dyk 2007). The evidence suggests that a second trimester routine ultrasound makes little or no di erence to the number of women undergoing caesarean section (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.12; 22,193 participants, five studies; low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to study design limitations) (Analysis 2.11). Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Routine ultrasound in the second trimester may reduce induction of labour for suspected post-maturity (average RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.73; 24,174 participants, six studies; low-certainty evidence, downgraded for study limitations and heterogeneity.Due to heterogeneity we used random-e ects analysis for this outcome) (Analysis 2.12).Furthermore, induction of labour for any cause may be reduced, however there was high heterogeneity for this outcome and again we used random e ects analysis (average RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.00; 23,267 participants, five studies; lowcertainty evidence) (Analysis 2.13). The evidence is very uncertain about the e ect of routine second trimester scan on the number of women terminating pregnancy for any cause (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.14 to 6.95; 463 participants, one study; low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to study limitations and imprecision) (Analysis 2.14). Routine second trimester ultrasound may increase detection of major fetal abnormality before 24 weeks (RR 3.45, 95% CI 1.67 to 7.12; 387 participants, two studies; low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to design limitations and imprecision.Imprecision due to low event rate and sample size) (Analysis 2.15). Routine second trimester scan probably increases the number of women terminating pregnancy for major anomaly (RR 2.36, 95% CI 1.13 to 4.93; 26,893 participants, four studies; moderate-certainty evidence, downgraded due to study limitations) (Analysis 2.16). The large RADIUS 1993 study reported on a composite outcome for serious neonatal morbidity and there was very little di erence between the ultrasound and control groups (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.36; 15,281 participants, one study) (Analysis 2.17). Routine versus selective ultrasound may make little or no di erence to neonatal death (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.28; 25,396 participants, three studies; low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to study design limitations) (Analysis 2.18). The evidence suggests little to no di erence in admission of infants to intensive or special care unit (definitions may not have been the same in all studies) (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.01; 17,484 participants, six studies) (Analysis 2.19). There is no evidence of a di erence in mean birthweight between the two groups (MD 16.79, 95% CI -6.44 to 40.03; 23,177 participants, five studies) (Analysis 2.20). There was little to no di erence between groups for low birthweight (< 2500 g) (average RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.74 to One study reported the number of infants that were small for gestational age and there was no evidence of a di erence between groups (RR 1.47, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.35; 964 participants, one study) (Analysis 2.23). A follow-up into childhood of 603 babies included in the Bakketeig 1984 trial suggested that the evidence is uncertain of whether scans during pregnancy have any e ect on dyslexia due to imprecision of results (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.34; 603 participants, one study; low-certainty evidence) (Analysis 2.24). There were no data to assess the e ects of routine ultrasound on the overall cost of care, but RADIUS 1993 estimated the average costs of routine ultrasound to be USD 200/scan, or USD 89.28 per patient. The following outcomes were not reported in the studies in this comparison.Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews review outcomes.We used the generic inverse variance method in our data and analysis; although the total sample size is shown in the forest plots the event rates are not.We have therefore included event rates as part of our presentation of results in the text.However, these rates are for illustrative purposes only as they do not reflect the adjustment made by the trialists in calculating relative e ects. This outcome was not reported in the trial. Perinatal loss (defined as miscarriage including termination of pregnancy or intrauterine death a er trial entry, or death of a liveborn infant up to 28 days of age or before discharge from hospital). This outcome was not reported in the trial. Adjusted data suggests that standard care plus two ultrasounds, and co-intervention of training of healthcare workers and referral for complications probably makes little or no di erence to IUFD (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.04; 46,904 participants; moderate-certainty evidence, downgraded for study design limitations) (e ect estimate based on adjusted data: 675/24,254 versus 628/23,149 in the intervention and control groups respectively) (Analysis 3.1). The trial also assessed whether or not women with pregnancy complications gave birth in hospital with facilities for caesarean section; again there was little to no di erences between groups (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.19; 11,680 participants, one study; moderatecertainty evidence, downgraded for study design limitations) (e ect estimate based on adjusted data, actual data: 2569/6,152 versus 2252/5,528 in the intervention and control groups respectively (the numerators are the number of complicated labours) (Analysis 3.2). The trialists collected data on the number of women attending for antenatal visits on at least four occasions.Adjusted data suggests there is probably little or no di erence between groups (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.18; 46,904 participants, one study; moderatecertainty evidence, downgraded for study design limitations) (e ect estimate based on adjusted data; actual data: 12,021/24,008 versus 10,866/22,896 in the intervention and control groups respectively) (Analysis 3.3). Evidence suggests that standard care plus two ultrasounds, and co-intervention of training of healthcare workers and referral for complications may make little or no di erence to caesarean section (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.04; 46,904 participants, one study; lowcertainty evidence, downgraded for study design limitations and imprecision) (e ect estimate based on unadjusted data, actual data: 2919/24,008 versus 2808/22,896 in the intervention and control groups, respectively) (Analysis 3.4). The evidence is very uncertain about whether standard care plus two ultrasounds, and co-intervention of training of healthcare workers and referral for complications makes any di erence to maternal mortality (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.55; 46 ,768 participants, one study; low-certainty evidence, downgraded for study design limitations and imprecision) (e ect estimate based on unadjusted data: 28/23,923 versus 29/22,845 in the intervention and control groups respectively) (Analysis 3.5). The intervention also probably makes little or no di erence to neonatal death (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.14; 45,974 participants, one study; moderate-certainty evidence, downgraded for study design limitations) (e ect estimate based on adjusted data, actual data: 546/23,495 versus 543/22,479 in the intervention and control groups, respectively) (Analysis 3.6). Moderate-certainty evidence suggested the intervention probably makes little or no di erence to low birthweight (< 2500 g) (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.13; 47,312 One study contributed to this comparison with 1,095 women (Bennett 1982) . This outcome was not reported in the trial. Perinatal loss (defined as miscarriage including termination of pregnancy or intrauterine death a er trial entry, or death of a liveborn infant up to 28 days of age or before discharge from hospital) The evidence is very uncertain about the e ect of a revealed ultrasound scan compared to not revealed on pregnancy loss (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.57 to 3.14; 1062 participants, one study; very lowcertainty evidence, downgraded due to imprecision (wide 95% CI crossing the line of no e ect, single study and low event rate) (Analysis 4.1) and perinatal death (RR 1.67, 95% CI 0.40 to 6.94; 1062 participants, one study; very low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to imprecision (wide 95% CI crossing the line of no e ect, single study and low event rate) (Analysis 4.2).Even when excluding lethal abnormalities the evidence was still found to be of very uncertain for perinatal death (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.30 to 5.92; 1073 participants, one study; very low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to imprecision (wide 95% CI crossing the line of no e ect, single study and low event rate). The evidence is very uncertain about the e ect of revealed scans on IUFD (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.18 to 21.99; 1062 participants, one study; very low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to imprecision (wide 95% CI crossing the line of no e ect, single study and low event rate) (Analysis 4.4). The evidence is very uncertain about the e ect of revealed scans on detection of multiple pregnancy before 24-26 weeks (RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.92; 11 participants, one study; very low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to imprecision (wide 95% CI crossing the line of no e ect, single study and low event rate), respectively (Analysis 4.5). The evidence is very uncertain about the e ect of revealed scans on women undergoing induction of labour for any reason (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.24; 1062 participants, one study; very low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to imprecision (wide 95% CI crossing the line of no e ect, single study and low event rate) (Analysis 4.6). The evidence is very uncertain about the e ect of revealed scans on women undergoing termination of pregnancy for any cause (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.39 to 3.45; 1062 participants, one study; very lowcertainty evidence, downgraded due to imprecision (wide 95% CI crossing the line of no e ect, single study and low event rate).(Analysis 4.7). The evidence is very uncertain about the e ect of revealed scans on neonatal deaths (RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.25 to 8.94; 1062 participants, one study; very low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to imprecision (wide 95% CI crossing the line of no e ect, single study and low event rate) (Analysis 4.8). The evidence is very uncertain about the e ect of revealed scans on low birthweight (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.61; 1062 participants, one study; very low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to imprecision (wide 95% CI crossing the line of no e ect, single study and low event rate) (Analysis 4.9). The following outcomes were not reported in the study in this comparison. There is moderate-certainty evidence that first trimester scans probably reduces short-term maternal anxiety about pregnancy, but it is not clear if the e ect is sustained (moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the e ect of first trimester scans on pregnancy loss or inductions of labour for post-maturity (low-certainty evidence). The e ect of routine first trimester ultrasound on birth before 34 weeks or termination of pregnancy for fetal abnormality was not reported in studies. Second trimester scans probably makes little to no di erence to pregnancy loss or intrauterine fetal death (moderate-certainty evidence). Routine ultrasound in the second trimester may reduce induction of labour for suspected post-maturity (moderate-certainty evidence). Routine second trimester ultrasound may increase detection of major fetal abnormality before 24 weeks (moderate-certainty evidence) and probably increases the number of women terminating pregnancy for major anomaly (moderate-certainty evidence). Second trimester routine scans may reduce non-detection of multiple pregnancy before 24 to 26 weeks\\' gestation (low-certainty evidence). Long-term follow-up of children exposed to scans before birth did not indicate that scans are harmful to children\\'s physical or intellectual development (low-certainty evidence). The e ect of routine second trimester ultrasound on birth before 34 weeks or maternal anxiety was not reported in studies. The additional scans and interventions in the intervention arm probably makes little to no di erence to whether or not women with pregnancy complications gave birth in hospital with facilities for caesarean section (moderate-certainty evidence), low birth weight (< 2500 g) or maternal mortality. Revealed ultrasound results (communicated to both patient and doctor) versus concealed ultrasound results (blinded to both patient and doctor) at any time before 24 weeks) The evidence was very uncertain for all results relating to revealed versus concealed ultrasound scan (very low-certainty evidence). The review includes several large trials, although the eligibility criteria among the trials di er.Therefore, the results may not be generalisable to all women.Additionally, ultrasound itself is unlikely to improve maternal or fetal outcomes; rather, it will be the interventions that could be o ered, based on the information provided by ultrasound in particular situations, that alters outcomes. The majority of studies were carried out in high-resource settings where the overall level of perinatal mortality is low and the contribution of major fetal abnormality to mortality is higher than in lower-resource settings.Findings in high-resource settings may not apply in less-a luent settings and countries.One trial involving a complex intervention contributed data from low-and middleincome countries. The di erent studies were carried out over a time period of more than 30 years.During that time, changes in scanning guidelines, technical advances in equipment, more widespread use of ultrasonography in the world, and training and expertise of operators are likely to have resulted in more e ective sonography, particularly for the detection of fetal abnormalities. For many of the primary outcomes (maternal anxiety and perinatal loss) in this review, the authors recognised a lack of trial evidence. The review includes several large, well-designed trials.Lack of blinding is a problem common to all of the studies and this may have an e ect on some outcomes.In several studies, a high number of women in the control group also had ultrasound examinations, especially in the Goldenberg 2018 trial, which was a cluster-RCT conducted in several low-and middle-income countries.In some countries, up to 95% of women in the control group had an ultrasound, whereas in others, only very few women had a scan in the control arm.Key outcomes were adjusted by the trialists and the authors used them whenever available, as per Cochrane guidance. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence for all primary review outcomes.The certainty of evidence for maternal anxiety and perinatal death was low.Downgrading of evidence was based on including studies with design limitations, imprecision of results and presence of heterogeneity.For some of the outcomes, such as perinatal loss, the event rate was very low.The pooled Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews e ect was provided by studies with design limitations, including poor reporting of allocation concealment methods, in all GRADE outcomes.In two of the first trimester outcomes, we downgraded for serious imprecision, due to the wide 95% CI crossing the line of no e ect.In one second trimester outcome, we downgraded for inconsistency (serious heterogeneity, I = 68%). RCTs published before 1996 were done before the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement was first published, and therefore could not be compliant with its standards (Begg 1996) . The possibility of introducing bias was present at every stage of the reviewing process.We attempted to minimise bias in a number of ways: two review authors assessed eligibility for inclusion, carried out data extraction and assessed risk of bias.Each worked independently.Nevertheless, the process of assessing risk of bias, for example, is not an exact science and includes many personal judgements.Furthermore, the process of reviewing research studies is known to be a ected by prior beliefs and attitudes.It is di icult to control for this type of bias in the reviewing process. While we attempted to be as inclusive as possible in the search strategy, the literature identified was predominantly written in English and published in North American and European journals.Although we did attempt to assess reporting bias, constraints of time meant that this assessment largely relied on information available in the published trial reports and thus, reporting bias was not usually apparent. Our data showed that routine ultrasound before 14 weeks can reduce maternal anxiety around the time of the scan.Garcia 2002, a systematic review of studies on women\\'s views about antenatal screening and diagnosis illustrated how attractive ultrasound in pregnancy is to women and their partners.The review included 74 primary studies from 18 countries that employed a wide range of methods ranging from qualitative interviewing to psychometric testing.The main finding was that not all women were aware of the purpose of ultrasound scanning in pregnancy.This lack of knowledge le some women vulnerable to anxiety and disappointment if the scan detected a problem, especially in situations where women were not counselled that the scan was to screen for abnormalities.The lack of information on the intention of scanning before 24 weeks can do also lead to women believing that if no abnormalities are detected, this means that all must be well.The review recommended that parents need clear information about the purpose and limitations of scans.Women need to know what to expect so that they can make informed decisions about their care and so that they are prepared for potential abnormal findings. With regard to similar outcomes in this review, the RADIUS 1993 of 15,530 women assessed if screening ultrasound in low-risk pregnancies would improve perinatal outcomes.This trial showed no di erences in maternal outcomes and found similar rates of induced abortion and Caesarean section. This evidence suggests that first trimester ultrasound may reduce short-term anxiety in pregnancy.Second trimester routine ultrasound may reduce the numbers of inductions for postmaturity.Second trimester ultrasound may improve the detection of major fetal abnormalities and increases termination of pregnancies with fetal abnormality.It may reduce the number of undetected twin pregnancies by 24 weeks.This accords with observational data.This review may underestimate the e ect size in modern practice because the trials mostly date from relatively early in the development of the ultrasound technology and many participants in the control arms also underwent ultrasound.The evidence that neither first nor second trimester routine ultrasound alters other maternal or fetal outcomes may also be an e ect of the relatively low event rates of these outcomes or whether intervention is o ered or not, based on the information provided by ultrasound.First and second trimester ultrasound did not appear to increase or decrease the numbers of caesarean section and this may well be because many indications for caesarean section only become apparent in the third trimester of pregnancy. Future trials comparing routine with selective or no ultrasound will be di icult for two reasons.Firstly, ultrasound examinations are already widely used.Our observation of the large number of scans in the control groups in the trials we reviewed suggests that this problem a ected past trials in addition.Secondly, the sample sizes of any trial which had a reasonable chance of detecting a clinically important e ects on perinatal death, or any other substantive outcome, would need to be huge.For example, assuming a control group estimate of perinatal death of 3 per 1000, the majority of these being due to prematurity would not be altered by accurate dating.At most, accurate dating might reduce mortality to 2 per 1000.A trial to test such a hypothesis would require 39,000 per group (alpha 0.05, beta 0.2).A trial to test a more plausible hypothesis that perinatal mortality fell from 3 per 1000 to 2.8 per 1000 would require 1,135,000 participants per group.Such a trial is not feasible.Future research on the e ectiveness of scanning before 24 weeks could therefore be based on observational data.

Exclusion criteria: women found to not be pregnant, not willing to participate, induced abortion before randomisation Experimental intervention: (510 women).Ultrasound examinations in the 19th and 32nd weeks of pregnancy.The aim of the 19 week scan was to determine the number of fetuses, locate the placenta, measure fetal biparietal diameter to assess gestational age and predict expected date of delivery.The second scan assessed biparietal diameter, the mean abdominal diameter, final placental location and fetal presentation.67 women had additional scans. Comparison intervention: (499 women).Routine antenatal care with selective scan (41 women were referred for scans) Study prospectively registered: not reported There were no established growth curves for mean abdominal diameter at the onset of the study, therefore these measurements were not consistently used to detect growth retardation. Outcome assessment known to sta although it was stated that newborn outcomes were assessed by sta unaware of allocation, so these may have been at lower risk of bias High risk 54 of 510 (10.6%) women in the screening group failed to attend the first scan and an additional 33 (7.2%) failed to attend the second screening scan.

Exclusion criteria: women who had an indication for a first trimester ultrasound or already had an ultrasound examination, known multiple pregnancy, under 19 years old with no guardian present, or non consenting Interventions 218 women with singleton pregnancies were randomised, 10 women assigned to the intervention group and 12 to the control group had early pregnancy loss or were otherwise lost to follow up Methods Randomised controlled trial.Individual randomisation. Tertiary level hospital in Adelaide, Austalia Inclusion criteria: women were recruited at their first antenatal visit if this visit was before 17 weeks\\' gestation, they had no previous ultrasound scans in this pregnancy and were expected to give birth at the study hospital. Exclusion criteria: women were excluded if they had an indication for an ultrasound at their first antenatal visit. Interventions 648 women were recruited to the trial.Women were enrolled by telephone randomisation to either the intervention arm or the control arm. Experimental intervention: (321 women) Ultrasound examination at their first antenatal visit.The assessment included fetal cardiac activity, estimation of gestational age, limited assessment of fetal morphology and the number of fetuses present.The mean gestational age of these first visit scans was at 10.7 weeks (SD 2.7 weeks).The report of the scan was available to caregivers to plan timing of maternal serum screening bloods and the 18-20 weeks ultrasound morphology scan.(The report was not made available to the person carrying out the 18-20 week scan.) Comparison intervention: (327 women).Routine antenatal care, no scan at the first visit. Women in both groups completed an anxiety questionnaire at the end of their first antenatal visit. Women in both the intervention and control group had a routine 18-20 week ultrasound. Adjustment for gestational age, perinatal loss, anxiety at the end of the first visit (measured on a Likert scale), TOP for any reason, caesarean section (The primary outcomes (used in power calculation) in the study were adjustment of the estimated due date of 10 days or more on the basis of their morphology scan and women booked for serum screening blood tests and morphology scans at inappropriate gestational ages. Sta carrying out 18-20 week scans did not have access to earlier reports, but it was not clear whether they were aware that an earlier scan had been performed.Sta may have been aware of allocation when administering anxiety questionnaires. Low risk Primary analysis was on an ITT basis.Data available for 602/648 women randomised (93%).There were some missing data (22/321 women in the intervention group and 24/327 in the control group had no 18-20 week scan data). Missing data wee mainly accounted for by miscarriage which was balanced across groups. Selective reporting (reporting bias) The outcomes regarding anxiety were not fully explained and were not clear. Trial was registered and all relevant outcomes stated were reported in findings including non-significant results. There was no evidence of differences in baseline characteristics.It was not reported how many of the women attending the hospital were eligible for inclusion which may affect generalisability. Methods Randomised controlled trial.Individual randomisation. All women attending for their first antenatal care visit at the clinics of 35 general practitioners in Alesund, Norway.The study population is representative for pregnant women who lived in this region of Norway at that time. Inclusion criteria: women living in Alesund, Norway Exclusion criteria: non-consenting In total 1628 women were randomised. Experimental intervention: (825 women).Ultrasound examinations at 18th and 32th weeks of pregnancy.At 18th weeks the number of fetuses and the position of the placenta were recorded.A general examination of the fetus was carried out and biparietal diameter was measured to estimate gestational age.At 32 weeks biparietal diameter was measured to assess growth, placental position and fetal presentation were noted.If fetal growth restriction was suspected or presentation was breech women were offered a further scan at 36 weeks.In addition women were offered scans at any time if clinically indicated (on average women in the intervention group had 2.5 scans). Comparison intervention: (803 women).Routine antenatal care with selective scan.481/727 women with singleton pregnancies did not undergo scans. Sample size calculation on post-term inductions of labour, data collected on hospital admissions, infant size and condition at birth, perinatal mortality, twin pregnancies diagnosed before 26 weeks. Preliminary results from the trial were published as a letter in 1984 and reported a study population of 1628 women, of whom 809 were randomised to ultrasound screening and 819 were controls.In a later follow-up of the children at 8 or 9 years of age, it was disclosed that 825 women were randomised to screening and 803 women were randomised to be controls.Loss was balanced between groups, there were some missing data (< 10%) Selective reporting (reporting bias) Low risk Although study protocol is not available there was a re-analysis of data reported previously and appears accurate and complete Other bias Unclear risk Groups mainly appeared balanced at baseline but more women in the control group were non-smokers (69% vs 64%) (P value 0.02) Methods Randomised controlled trial.Stratified by participating practice size.

Exclusion criteria: pre-existing indication for ultrasound (unknown gestational age, size/date discrepancy of 4 weeks, previous stillbirth, diabetes, chronic hypertension, chronic renal disease, etc.), planned amniocentesis, repeat caesarean section, gestational age already confirmed on ultrasound, suspected molar/ectopic pregnancy, threatened/inevitable miscarriage, fetal death, presence of IUD More than half of the women screened for inclusion were not eligible.915/2171 screened were randomised.Half of the women excluded did not know menstrual dates or had already had a dating scan. Experimental intervention: (459 women randomised, 402 available for analysis).Early ultrasound examination between 10-12 weeks\\' gestation (but up to 18 weeks) to assess gestational age (using crownrump length (up to 13 weeks), biparietal diameter or femur length (after 13 weeks), number of fetuses, fetal viability and uterine or fetal abnormalities.337 of the women in the group received the scheduled routine ultrasound. Comparison intervention: (456 randomised, 413 available for analysis) Routine antenatal care with selective scan.96 women (23.9%) received a selected ultrasound scan between 10-18 weeks. Random sequence generation (selection bias) It was not clear how the randomisation sequence was generated, A system if blocks if 4 was used to assure a balanced distribution if patients in the screened and usual-care groups for each practice.It was not clear how many women were randomised at each of the participating clinics. Unclear risk Randomisation cards were placed in sequentially numbered sealed opaque envelopes.It was not clear if all envelopes were accounted for.The study used a Zelen post randomisation method and women decided to take part already knowing their assignment. High risk Participants would be aware of assignment at the point of treatment.Clinical sta would be aware of treatment allocation, which would affect clinical management and possibly other aspects of care. High risk Gestational age was calculated using (using crown-rump length (up to 13 weeks) or biparietal diameter or femur length (after 13 weeks) in the intervention group.The physicians were provided with the ultrasound results. High risk Of the 2171 screened patients 915 were eligible and had not exclusion criteria.Data were available for 815/915 randomised.337/402 in the experimental group had their scheduled ultrasound.96/413 in the control group had an indicated ultrasound scan between 10-18 weeks\\' gestation.

Other bias High risk There were protocol deviations with women not receiving the planned intervention.Baseline characteristics were similar although there were more nulliparous women in the intervention group (56.5%) vs controls (48.8%) and the number of twin pregnancies was greater in the control group. Methods Randomised controlled trial.Individual randomisation. Antenatal clinic and ultrasound unit within the area served by Tygerberg Hospital; a tertiary referral centre, South Africa. Inclusion criteria: women without risk factors for congenital anomalies referred for ultrasonography between 18 and 24 weeks\\' gestation.Women with uncertain dates of last menstrual period included. Exclusion criteria: women over 37 years of age, having had previous ultrasound in this pregnancy, women with increased risk of congenital abnormalities, diabetes mellitus or rhesus sensitisation. All outcomes Similar numbers of patients excluded in both groups for not pregnant or lost for follow up. Selective reporting (reporting bias) Trial not registered.Outcomes in the methods section fully reported. Other bias not identified. Cluster-randomised controlled trial. Multi-centre trial in 58 sites (clusters) in 5 countries: Pakistan (10), Kenya (12), Zambia (10), Democratic Republic of Congo ( 8), and Guatemala (18).Intervention and control clusters were stratified by country, and factors such as historic perinatal mortality rates and logistic factors such as travel time to Emergency Obstetric and Neonatal Care facilities were also taken into account.Each cluster was defined by a health centre and its catchment area with approximately 500 births per year.The 58 clusters (29 intervention and 29 control) were in mainly rural areas. Participants 46,904 women delivered in the cluster areas over the study period. Inclusion criteria: all pregnant women attending clinics able to give informed consent and living in the study cluster at or after 18 weeks\\' gestation. Exclusion criteria: women in labour Experimental intervention: (24,008 women in 29 clusters).This was a complex intervention involving training health workers (nurses, midwives and clinical officers) to perform ultrasound at 16-22 and 32-36 weeks\\' gestation.Women identified with complications were to be referred to hospital.There were also community sensitization activities to inform women of the ultrasound clinics.A further component of the intervention was training provided to sta in referral hospitals to provide care in major obstetric and neonatal emergencies (such as newborn resuscitation).Unclear risk \"lost-to-follow up rates similar between….groups\"There were discrepancies in the number of clusters and in some of the outcome data reported in the protocol and subsequent papers.These discrepancies were not explained. Selective reporting (reporting bias) The trial was registered and main objectives reported.Analyses took account of cluster design effect. There was some protocol deviation.In the intervention clusters 77.6% of women received at least one study ultrasound.There was considerable variation in different settings with regard to ultrasound use in control groups (95% in Pakistan vs < 5% in African countries). Other considerations: clusters were stratified by country and took account of baseline differences between settings.However, there was huge variation between cluster sites in terms of baseline mortality rates and maternity care provision and utilisation.Stillbirth rates ranged between 22 to 54 per 1000 and neonatal mortality between 16 to 45 per 1000 infants.Baseline caesarean section rates ranged from 0.1% in Democratic Republic Kongo to 11.4% in Guatemala.Birth location and birth attendant also varied considerably.Despite adjustment to take account of cluster design, these large variations between sites means that overall results are more difficult to interpret. Methods Randomised controlled trial.Individual randomisation. Participants 20 collaborating general practices and a district teaching hospital in the United Kingdom Inclusion criteria: women attending their GP practice, in the first trimester of pregnancy, no obstetric indication for a first trimester ultrasound examination. Exclusion criteria: indication for a first trimester scan Low risk Participating general practices were provided with a series of consecutively numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes randomised in blocks of six, which allocated the women to the \\'scan\\' or \\'no-scan\\' group. Blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias) All outcomes The estimated due date was recalculated if the scan dates differed by more than 5 days with the menstrual dates.The estimated due date was entered into the patient\\'s obstetric notes, and all subsequent management decisions were based on this assessment of gestational age. High risk Multiple gestations were disclosed as were suspected structural fetal anomalies with referral to the prenatal diagnosis unit.Nonviable or ectopic pregnancies were managed appropriately.

At second-look laparoscopy, we are uncertain whether oxidised regenerated cellulose at laparoscopy reduced the incidence of de novo adhesions (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.83, 3 RCTs, 360 participants; I = 75%; very low-quality evidence) or of re-formed adhesions (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.41, 3 RCTs, 100 participants; I = 36%; very low-quality evidence). At second-look laparoscopy, we are uncertain whether oxidised regenerated cellulose a ected the incidence of de novo adhesions a er laparotomy (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.25, 1 RCT, 271 participants; very low-quality evidence).However, the incidence of re-formed adhesions may have been reduced in the intervention group (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.55, 6 RCTs, 554 participants; I = 41%; low-quality evidence). No studies reported results on pelvic pain, live birth rate, adhesion score, or clinical pregnancy rate. We are uncertain whether expanded polytetrafluoroethylene reduced the incidence of de novo adhesions at second-look laparoscopy (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.26 to 3.41, 38 participants; very low-quality evidence).We are also uncertain whether expanded polytetrafluoroethylene resulted in a lower adhesion score (out of 11) (MD -3.79, 95% CI -5.12 to -2.46, 62 participants; very low-quality evidence) or a lower risk of re-formed adhesions (OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.80, 23 participants; very low-quality evidence) when compared with oxidised regenerated cellulose. No studies reported results regarding pelvic pain, live birth rate, or clinical pregnancy rate. Evidence suggests that collagen membrane with polyethylene glycol and glycerol may reduce the incidence of adhesions at secondlook laparoscopy (OR 0.04, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.77, 47 participants; low-quality evidence).We are uncertain whether collagen membrane with polyethylene glycol and glycerol improved clinical pregnancy rate (OR 5.69, 95% CI 1.38 to 23.48, 39 participants; very low-quality evidence). One study reported adhesion scores but reported them as median scores rather than mean scores (median score 0.8 in the treatment group vs median score 1.2 in the control group) and therefore could not be included in the meta-analysis.The reported P value was 0.230, and no evidence suggests a di erence between treatment and control groups. No studies reported results regarding pelvic pain or live birth rate. In total, 15 of the 19 RCTs included in this review reported adverse events.No events directly attributed to adhesion agents were reported. We found no evidence on the e ects of barrier agents used during pelvic surgery on pelvic pain or live birth rate in women of reproductive age because no trial reported these outcomes. It is di icult to draw credible conclusions due to lack of evidence and the low quality of included studies.Given this caveat, low-quality evidence suggests that collagen membrane with polyethylene glycol plus glycerol may be more e ective than no treatment in reducing the incidence of adhesion formation following pelvic surgery.Low-quality evidence also shows that oxidised regenerated cellulose may reduce the incidence of re-formation of adhesions when compared with no treatment at laparotomy.It is not possible to draw conclusions on the relative e ectiveness of these interventions due to lack of evidence. No adverse events directly attributed to the adhesion agents were reported.The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate.Common limitations were imprecision and poor reporting of study methods.Most studies were commercially funded, and publication bias could not be ruled out.\\nBody Text: Pelvic adhesions can form secondary to inflammation, endometriosis, or surgical trauma.Strategies to reduce pelvic adhesion formation include placing barrier agents such as oxidised regenerated cellulose, polytetrafluoroethylene, and fibrin or collagen sheets between pelvic structures. To evaluate the e ects of barrier agents used during pelvic surgery on rates of pain, live birth, and postoperative adhesions in women of reproductive age. We searched the following databases in August 2019: the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility (CGF) Specialised Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PsycINFO, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Epistemonikos, and trial registries.We searched reference lists of relevant papers, conference proceedings, and grey literature sources.We contacted pharmaceutical companies for information and handsearched relevant journals and conference abstracts. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on the use of barrier agents compared with other barrier agents, placebo, or no treatment for prevention of adhesions in women undergoing gynaecological surgery. Three review authors independently assessed trials for eligibility and risk of bias and extracted data.We calculated odds ratios (ORs) or mean di erences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a fixed-e ect model.We assessed the overall quality of the evidence using GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methods. We included 19 RCTs (1316 women).Seven RCTs randomised women; the remainder randomised pelvic organs.Laparoscopy (eight RCTs) and laparotomy (11 RCTs) were the primary surgical techniques.Indications for surgery included myomectomy (seven RCTs), ovarian surgery (five RCTs), pelvic adhesions (five RCTs), endometriosis (one RCT), and mixed gynaecological surgery (one RCT).The sole indication for surgery in three of the RCTs was infertility.Thirteen RCTs reported commercial funding; the rest did not state their source of funding. One study reported the e ect of collagen membrane with polyethylene glycol plus glycerol on postoperative adhesion score; however due to the way these data were reported, we are unable to interpret whether the intervention had any e ect.No studies reported the e ect of oxidised regenerated cellulose on adhesion score. One study reported the e ect of collagen membrane with polyethylene glycol plus glycerol on clinical pregnancy rate; however this evidence was found to be of very low quality.We are uncertain whether this intervention led to a higher clinical pregnancy rate than no treatment.No studies reported the e ect of any other intervention on clinical pregnancy rate. Two studies compared the e ects of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene and oxidised regenerated cellulose on adhesion score and adhesion formation.However, this evidence was found to be of very low quality, and we are uncertain whether either intervention was more e ective than the other.No studies compared the relative e ects of these interventions on pelvic pain, live birth rate, or clinical pregnancy rate. We found no conclusive evidence on the relative e ectiveness of any reported interventions.No adverse events directly attributed to the adhesion agents were reported. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate.The most common limitations were imprecision (few participants and wide confidence intervals) and poor reporting of study methods.Most studies were commercially funded, and publication bias could not be ruled out. Not reported in any study in this comparison *The basis for the assumed risk is the median control group risk across studies.The corresponding risk (and its 95% confidence interval) is based on the assumed risk in the comparison group and the relative effect of the intervention (and its 95% CI).CI: confidence interval; OR: odds ratio. Relative effect (95% CI) Not reported in any study in this comparison *The basis for the assumed risk is the median control group risk across studies.The corresponding risk (and its 95% confidence interval) is based on the assumed risk in the comparison group and the relative effect of the intervention (and its 95% CI). Pelvic adhesions can form as the result of pelvic inflammation, endometriosis, or surgical trauma.The incidence of pelvic adhesions at second-look laparoscopy in the first few weeks a er surgery has been reported to be between 25% and 92% (Okabayashi 2014).Consequences of adhesion formation include subfertility, development of chronic abdominal pain, and dyspareunia (di icult or painful sexual intercourse) (SRS 2007) .A recent study demonstrated that in women with a known reason for small-bowel obstruction, adhesions were the single most common cause (Ten Broek 2013). Cutting, surgical denudation, ischaemia, desiccation, or abrasion can cause peritoneal trauma during surgery.Subsequent healing in the peritoneal cavity occurs through a combination of mesothelial regeneration and fibrosis, resulting in adhesion formation between damaged serosal surfaces (diZerega 1990). Minimally invasive techniques such as laparoscopy reduce the risk of de novo (new) adhesion formation but do not eliminate it entirely.Studies included within this review therefore assessed both laparoscopy and laparotomy. Several barrier agents with di erent characteristics are commercially available.Oxidised regenerated cellulose was the first tested synthetic mechanical barrier agent to cover traumatised peritoneum in the pelvis.It is applied over raw tissue surfaces at the last stage of surgery a er haemostasis has been achieved, and it is designed to form a gelatinous protective coat within eight hours of application.Following this, it is broken down into its monosaccharide constituents and is designed to be absorbed within two weeks.Concerns with use of oxidised regenerated cellulose include migration and the need for meticulous haemostasis.Use of oxidised regenerated cellulose in the presence of bleeding may promote fibrin deposition at sites of incomplete haemostasis, resulting in adhesion formation rather than prevention (Wiseman 1999). Another commercially available barrier agent is expanded polytetrafluoroethylene surgical membrane.This inert and permanent barrier acts by preventing cellular growth.However, it must be sutured to remain in place, and this may increase the incidence of adhesions while prolonging operating time. Much debate is ongoing regarding the need to remove expanded polytetrafluoroethylene a er peritoneal healing is complete.This debate stems from studies investigating expanded polytetrafluoroethylene in vascular and pericardial gra s, which found no significant long-term adverse e ects when the barrier was not removed (Jacobs 1996).In addition, a prospective multi-centre observational study investigating the long-term use of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene without removal reported only one case of postoperative infection, which did not require removal of the membrane (Hurst 1998). Other products include sodium hyaluronate with carboxymethylcellulose, an adhesion barrier agent composed of chemically derived sodium hyaluronate and carboxymethylcellulose.It is designed to be absorbed from the peritoneal cavity within seven days and completely excreted from the body within 28 days (Diamond 1996) .Sodium hyaluronate with carboxymethylcellulose consists of chemically modified hyaluronic acid and carboxymethylcellulose.It separates denuded planes of tissue for up to seven days before it is absorbed.As with oxidised regenerated cellulose, migration is the cause of some concern; however no evidence suggests that its e ectiveness is altered by the presence of blood.Although evidence for its use in gynaecological surgery is limited, sodium hyaluronate with carboxymethylcellulose has been widely studied in the context of colorectal surgery.Formation of adhesions and incidence of smallbowel obstruction were reduced in five randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating its use in various colorectal and general surgical procedures (Ten Broek 2013). Another product is a dual-sided hydrophilic film.One side is a smooth surface consisting of porcine collagen, polyethylene glycol, and glycerol, and the opposite side is a porous surface made of lyophilised porcine collagen.The film is designed to degrade in the body within three weeks of application, and it has demonstrated significant reduction in adhesion formation in rat models (Gruber-Blum 2011). Fibrin sheet is a sheet-type fibrin sealant with a solid layer of human fibrinogen, thrombin, and aprotinin coating the active surface of equine collagen stained with riboflavin (Mais 1995a; Pellicno 2003) . Fluid and pharmacological methods used to prevent adhesion formation are investigated in another Cochrane Review (Ahmad 2014). Theoretically, inert physical materials that are able to prevent mechanical contact between serosal surfaces for longer than three days have the potential to be helpful in preventing adhesion formation.This would allow independent healing of each traumatised peritoneal surface.Some barrier agents (e.g.expanded polytetrafluoroethylene) need to be sutured into place, requiring extra operating time, especially during laparoscopic procedures. This review is concerned with the e ectiveness of barrier agents placed in the peritoneal cavity for preventing adhesions and in some cases for improving fertility.Pharmacological adjuncts are reviewed elsewhere.Women present with the secondary e ects of adhesions, including dyspareunia, subfertility, bowel obstruction, and chronic pelvic pain.These problems can greatly impact quality of life and may necessitate further surgery.No clinical consensus or guidance is available regarding the most e ective anti-adhesion agent.Assessment of the evidence on e ectiveness of barrier agents is therefore important. To evaluate the e ects of barrier agents used during pelvic surgery on rates of pain, live birth, and postoperative adhesions in women of reproductive age. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. We included published or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which either women or pelvic structures were the unit of randomisation.Non-randomised studies (e.g.studies with evidence of inadequate sequence generation such as alternate days or participant numbers) were excluded, as they are associated with high risk of bias.In the case of cross-over trials, only data from before the cross-over would have been included, as any additional pelvic surgery increases the risk of adhesion formation.However, no cross-over trials were identified. Women undergoing pelvic surgery for infertility or for other indications.Studies investigating adhesion prevention in nongynaecological specialties were excluded.Types of surgery performed could include open or laparoscopic procedures. Trials comparing physical barrier agents (oxidised regenerated cellulose, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, sodium hyaluronate with carboxymethylcellulose, fibrin sheet, collagen membrane with polyethylene glycol and glycerol) used during pelvic surgery versus any other physical barrier agent or placebo or no treatment were included. Studies of fibrin glue and Sepracoat (Genzyme Corporation) were excluded, as these are not physical barrier agents.Live birth rate and clinical pregnancy rate are relevant when studies have specifically investigated use of the barrier agent in procedures performed to improve fertility.This does not apply to some studies. Articles that met the inclusion criteria but did not report any of the outcomes considered within this review were also included within the qualitative analysis. We searched for all published and unpublished RCTs comparing the use of barrier agents versus any other active intervention or placebo/no treatment without language restriction.Searches were designed and conducted by the Information Specialist for Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility. We searched: These searches were conducted by the Information Specialist for the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group. Other electronic searches included trial registers for the US National Institutes of Health, the World Health Organization (WHO) international trial registry platform, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of E ects (DARE), OpenGrey, PubMed, Epistemonikos, and Google Scholar. We conducted the last search in August 2019. We also searched the reference lists of relevant publications, review articles, and included studies and contacted experts in the field to request additional data.We handsearched relevant journals and conference abstracts that were not covered in the CGF register, in liaison with the Information Specialist.Two review authors screened retrievals. A er an initial screen of titles and abstracts identified by the search, we retrieved the full text of all potentially eligible studies.Three review authors (PA, KK, MT) independently examined these full-text articles for compliance with inclusion criteria.Disagreements on study eligibility were resolved by consultation with a fourth review author (GA).Review authors corresponded with study investigators to clarify study eligibility (e.g. with respect to participant eligibility criteria and allocation method).Figure 1 shows a flow diagram of study selection. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Three review authors (PA, KK, MT) independently extracted data from eligible studies using a data extraction form that was designed and pilot-tested by the review authors.Disagreements were resolved by consultation with a fourth review author (GA).Data extracted included study characteristics and outcome data.When studies were followed by multiple publications, the main trial report was used as the reference, and additional details were derived from secondary papers.We corresponded with study investigators to ask for further data on methods and/or results, as required. We assessed each included trial for the following criteria using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool: sequence generation; allocation concealment; blinding of participants, personnel, and outcome assessors; completeness of outcome data; selective outcome reporting; and other potential sources of bias (Higgins 2011).We presented conclusions in the \\'Risk of bias\\' table and incorporated them into the interpretation of review findings by performing sensitivity analyses.Two review authors (KK, MT) independently performed all assessments of the quality of clinical trials.All discrepancies were resolved by GA and PA. Care was taken to search for within-study reporting bias, as seen in trials failing to report obvious outcomes (e.g.pregnancy rate, major complications) or reporting them in insu icient detail. Results of dichotomous variables are presented as Mantel-Haenszel odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and results of continuous variables are presented as mean di erences (MDs). We reversed the direction of e ects of individual studies, when required, to ensure consistency across trials.We treated ordinal data as continuous outcomes.We presented 95% CIs for all outcomes.When data used to calculate ORs or MDs were not available, we planned to utilise the most detailed numerical data available, which might facilitate similar analyses of included studies.We compared the magnitude and direction of e ects reported by studies versus how they are presented in the review, taking account of legitimate di erences. For within-participant designs, \\'e ective sample sizes\\' were calculated to allow for statistical synthesis, that is, for a trial randomly assigning ovaries within each participant rather than randomly assigning participants, numbers were calculated to simulate as nearly as possible the odds ratio and the confidence interval as if the study design had randomly assigned participants, not ovaries.This was achieved as follows. 1. We calculated the odds ratio and the 95% CI for the matched design. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2. We constrained the control rate in the hypothetical parallel design to make it equal to that observed in the matched design.3. We constrained group sizes for the parallel design to make them equal to each other.4. Based on the two constraints above, we calculated the numbers of \\'successes\\' and \\'failures\\' in each group to reproduce as nearly as possible the OR (95% CI) of the matched design. As a result of this type of re-analysis of data, studies with within-participant design that may have previously demonstrated significance may no longer do so. Several studies of within-participant design comparing oxidised regenerated cellulose versus no treatment were presented and analysed wrongly as having a parallel design.We recognised that failure to account for pairing and failure to take account of doubling the sample size by using ovaries instead of participants as the unit of randomisation may have yielded spurious results.For these studies, the least favourable outcome for oxidised regenerated cellulose that was compatible with the reported results was assumed.We attempted to obtain correct results tables from study authors but were unsuccessful. Data were analysed on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis as far as possible, and attempts were made to obtain missing data from the original investigators.When data for primary outcomes could not be obtained, we planned to undertake imputation of individual values.For secondary outcomes, only available data were analysed. If studies reported su icient detail to calculate mean di erences but no information on associated standard deviation (SD), we assumed that the outcome had a standard deviation equal to the highest SD from other studies within the same analysis. Clinical and methodological characteristics of individual studies were considered to ensure that any pooling was clinically meaningful.The I statistic was calculated to assess statistical heterogeneity.An I measurement over 50% was taken to indicate substantial heterogeneity. In view of the di iculties involved in detecting and correcting publication bias and other reporting biases, study authors aimed to minimise their potential impact by ensuring a comprehensive search for eligible studies, and by remaining alert for duplication of data.We aimed to minimise the impact by ensuring that a robust and comprehensive search was performed.We planned to create a funnel plot of 10 or more studies that were included in a metaanalysis to explore the possibility of small-study e ects (a tendency for estimates of the intervention e ect to suggest that it is more beneficial in smaller studies). Statistical analysis was performed in accordance with the guidelines developed by Cochrane.Data from the primary studies were combined in RevMan using the fixed-e ect model.We planned to report standardised mean di erences (SMDs) if similar outcomes were reported on di erent scales.An increase in OR, SMD, or MD was indicated to the right of the central line of the forest plot, and a decrease was indicated to the le of the central line.Whether this favoured treatment or no treatment depended on the outcome analysed, but the axes were labelled accordingly.Analyses were stratified by type of barrier agent, type of surgery, and type of control. If we had detected substantial heterogeneity, we planned to explore possible explanations via sensitivity analyses.We planned to take any statistical heterogeneity into account when interpreting the results, especially if any variation in the direction of e ect was evident. We conducted sensitivity analyses for the important review outcomes to determine whether the conclusions were robust to arbitrary decisions made regarding eligibility of studies and analysis.These analyses included consideration of whether review conclusions di ered if: 1. eligibility was restricted to studies without high risk of bias; 2. a random-e ects model had been adopted; or 3. relative risk had been used as the summary e ects measure. We prepared \\'Summary of findings\\' tables using GRADEpro so ware and Cochrane methods (GRADEpro GDT 2015; Higgins 2011).These tables evaluate the overall quality of the body of evidence for the main review outcomes (pelvic pain, live birth rate, clinical pregnancy rate, improvement or worsening of adhesion scores, and incidence of adhesions) using GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) criteria (study limitations (i.e.risk of bias), consistency of e ect, imprecision, indirectness, and publication bias).Judgements about evidence quality (high, moderate, or low) have been justified, documented, and incorporated into reporting of results for each outcome. At the 2020 update three studies were retrieved in full text.One new study was identified and was included within the meta-analysis in this update (Canis 2014), and two were excluded; there are now 19 included studies and 10 excluded.See Figure 1 for an overview of search results. At the 2015 update eighteen studies met inclusion criteria, and eight studies were excluded.See study tables under Characteristics of included studies.Reasons why studies were excluded are detailed in the Characteristics of excluded studies tables. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. We identified 19 RCTs that met the inclusion criteria (1309 participants). Ten were multi-centre studies (Azziz 1993; Canis 2014; Diamond 1996; Franklin 1995; Haney 1995; Myomectomy ASG 1995; Nordic APSG 1995; Sekiba 1992; Takeuchi 2005; Tinelli 2011) . In seven parallel-group trials, the unit of randomisation was the participant (Canis 2014; Diamond 1996; Mais 1995a; Mais 1995b; Takeuchi 2005; Tinelli 2011 Wallweiner 1998) .The remainder were within-participant trials in which the unit of randomisation was the ovary, uterine sites, or the pelvic sidewall.One study was a multi-arm trial comparing fibrin gel and a fibrin sheet versus control (Takeuchi 2005).Comparison of the fibrin sheet arm versus the control arm is included in this review. Thirteen trials stated sponsorship.Seven trials were sponsored by Johnson & Johnson (Azziz 1993; Franklin 1995; Li 1994; Nordic APSG 1995; Saravelos 1996; Sekiba 1992; van Geldorp 1994) , one was sponsored by Genzyme (Diamond 1996), one by Covidien (Canis 2014), and a further two trials by manufacturers of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (Haney 1995; Myomectomy ASG 1995) .One trial received additional sponsorship from the Medical Research Council (MRC) in Canada (Greenblatt 1993).Another trial received support from Johnson & Johnson a er the study was completed to help with the analysis, but the final content of the paper was under the sole control of the principal investigator (Keckstein 1996). Myomectomy was the indication in six trials (Canis 2014; Diamond 1996; Mais 1995b; Myomectomy ASG 1995; Takeuchi 2005; Tinelli 2011) , and ovarian surgery was the indication in four trials (Greenblatt 1993; Keckstein 1996; Saravelos 1996; van Geldorp 1994) .Three trials were restricted to women undergoing adhesiolysis for infertility (Azziz 1993; Nordic APSG 1995; Sekiba 1992) .Participants also underwent adhesiolysis in Li 1994, although the indications were subgrouped into infertility or pelvic pain.The indication for the Haney 1995 trial was also pelvic adhesions, although the primary reason for surgery was not exclusively infertility, and this trial was not subgrouped.The indications were endometriosis in Mais 1995a and Wallweiner 1998, and bilateral ovarian disease in Franklin 1995. Laparotomy was performed in nine trials (Azziz 1993; Canis 2014; Diamond 1996; Franklin 1995; Li 1994; Myomectomy ASG 1995; Nordic APSG 1995; Sekiba 1992; van Geldorp 1994) , and laparoscopy was performed in the remainder (Greenblatt 1993; Haney 1995; Keckstein 1996; Korell 1994; Mais 1995a; Mais 1995b; Saravelos 1996; Takeuchi 2005; Wallweiner 1998 ).Tinelli 2011 performed both laparoscopy and laparotomy. Oxidised regenerated cellulose was occasionally sutured into place (Keckstein 1996; Li 1994; Sekiba 1992 ), whereas expanded polytetrafluoroethylene was always sutured into place (Haney 1995; Korell 1994; Myomectomy ASG 1995) . One trial compared oxidised regenerated cellulose versus no treatment; hydrocortisone was also instilled in both treatment and control groups (Li 1994). In three trials, it was noted that microsurgery was performed (Azziz 1993; Li 1994; Nordic APSG 1995) . 1. Thirteen RCTs compared oxidised regenerated cellulose with no treatment -six at laparoscopy (Keckstein 1996; Mais 1995a; Mais 1995b; Saravelos 1996; Tinelli 2011; Wallweiner 1998) , and seven at laparotomy (Azziz 1993; Franklin 1995; Li 1994; Nordic APSG 1995; Sekiba 1992; Tinelli 2011; van Only two studies stated a mean time a er laparoscopy (Diamond 1996 -23 days; Haney 1995 -30 days).Large variation was noted in timing of the SLL both within and between studies.Only three studies performed all SLL procedures within six weeks (Greenblatt 1993; Haney 1995; Myomectomy ASG 1995) .Only four further studies performed SLL a er eight weeks (Keckstein 1996; Mais 1995a; Mais 1995b; Wallweiner 1998) .Remaining studies performed SLL a er 10 days to 20 weeks. Tinelli 2011 did not routinely perform SLL but instructed participants to have any further surgery completed within a six-year period.Adhesions were assessed at the second surgery.Timing of the second surgery varied between 2.3 and 2.5 years.

Adhesion score Only one study reported mean adhesion score as an outcome (Haney 1995) .Another study reported median adhesion score as an outcome (Canis 2014). Nine trials reported the incidence of de novo adhesions as an outcome (Canis 2014; Diamond 1996; Greenblatt 1993; Korell 1994; Mais 1995b; Myomectomy ASG 1995; Saravelos 1996; Takeuchi 2005; Tinelli 2011 ).Ten trials reported the incidence of re-formation adhesions as an outcome (Azziz 1993; Franklin 1995; Haney 1995; Keckstein 1996; Li 1994; Mais 1995a; Nordic APSG 1995; Sekiba 1992; van Geldorp 1994; Wallweiner 1998 ). One study reported this outcome (Canis 2014). No trials reported this outcome. One study reported this outcome (Canis 2014). No trials reported this outcome. Fourteen studies reported adverse e ects as an outcome (Azziz 1993; Canis 2014; Diamond 1996; Franklin 1995; Haney 1995; Keckstein 1996; Mais 1995a; Mais 1995b; Myomectomy ASG 1995; Nordic APSG 1995; Saravelos 1996; Takeuchi 2005; Tinelli 2011; van Geldorp 1994) .In the remaining studies, the absence of adverse e ects was not stated. Ten studies were excluded.In nine studies, the agent used as the intervention was not a barrier agent, and one study did not investigate use of a barrier agent during a gynaecological procedure (To 1992). See Figure 2 and Figure 3 for a summary diagram.Ten studies were rated as having unclear risk of bias.Study authors did not detail the randomly assigned component despite stating that these were randomised studies (Azziz 1993; Franklin 1995; Greenblatt 1993; Korell 1994; Li 1994; Nordic APSG 1995; Saravelos 1996; Sekiba 1992; van Geldorp 1994; Wallweiner 1998 ). Nine studies were deemed to have low risk of bias for sequence generation (Canis 2014; Diamond 1996; Haney 1995; Keckstein 1996; Mais 1995a; Mais 1995b; Myomectomy ASG 1995; Takeuchi 2005; Tinelli 2011 ). Eight studies were deemed to have low risk of selection bias (Canis 2014; Diamond 1996; Haney 1995; Keckstein 1996; Li 1994; Mais 1995a; Mais 1995b; Myomectomy ASG 1995) .The remaining 11 studies were deemed to have unclear risk of selection bias. Although five of these studies used sealed envelopes, investigators did not detail the methods used to develop and monitor the allocation process with sealed envelopes (Azziz 1993; Franklin 1995; Nordic APSG 1995; Saravelos 1996; Sekiba 1992) . Due to the nature of the intervention and the lack of comparable placebo agents, no study achieved blinding of the primary surgeon.However, by revealing the treatment allocation only a er completing the initial surgical intervention, seven studies were deemed to have minimised performance bias (Azziz 1993; Canis 2014; Diamond 1996; Franklin 1995; Haney 1995; Keckstein 1996; Li 1994) . Twelve studies were rated to have unclear risk of performance bias (Greenblatt 1993; Korell 1994; Mais 1995a; Mais 1995b; Myomectomy ASG 1995; Nordic APSG 1995; Saravelos 1996; Sekiba 1992; Takeuchi 2005; Tinelli 2011; van Geldorp 1994; Wallweiner 1998 ), as study authors did not clearly state whether participants were blinded and/or whether treatment allocation was revealed before or during the initial surgery. Nine studies clearly stated that assessors at SLL were blinded (Canis 2014; Diamond 1996; Greenblatt 1993; Li 1994; Mais 1995a; Mais 1995b; Saravelos 1996; Sekiba 1992; Tinelli 2011) .Two of these studies recorded the SLL in video, and blinded independent assessors watched those videos to grade the severity of adhesions (Canis 2014; Diamond 1996) .However, in Canis 2014, video recording was not performed in seven of the SLL patients, meaning that these patients were not assessed by a blinded independent surgeon, potentially increasing the risk of detection bias.Therefore, we included only the data from independently performed SLL from Canis 2014 in our final data analysis. Eight studies did not clearly state that the surgeon performing the SLL was blinded to the initial intervention (Franklin 1995; Keckstein 1996; Korell 1994; Myomectomy ASG 1995; Nordic APSG 1995; Takeuchi 2005; van Geldorp 1994; Wallweiner 1998 ). Two studies were deemed to have high risk of detection bias, as the surgeons at SLL were not blinded to the intervention group (Azziz 1993; Haney 1995) . Fourteen studies blinded surgeons to randomisation at secondlook laparoscopy, three studies did not discuss blinding (Haney 1995; Myomectomy ASG 1995; van Geldorp 1994) , and two studies did not use blinding (Azziz 1993; Takeuchi 2005) . Four studies were rated as high risk, 10 as unclear risk, and five as low risk. Azziz 1993 reported a large number of dropouts.A total of 198 participants were randomly assigned, but 64 were excluded from analysis because of inadequate documentation in 23, surgical technique and evaluation inconsistent with the protocol in 36, concurrent therapy in conflict with the protocol in three, and participant refusal to undergo second-look laparoscopy in two (Wiseman 1999), demonstrating high risk of bias.Keckstein 1996 also reported a large number of dropouts, with 8 of 25 participants not returning for SLL.No reason was given for this.Canis 2014 reported a large number of dropouts as well, with 7 of 61 patients not undergoing second-look laparoscopy and 21 of 61 not returning for three-year follow-up. Tinelli 2011 reported participants undergoing a second surgical procedure within six years of initial surgery: 546 of 694 participants underwent a second surgery.In contrast to other trials, a secondlook laparoscopy at a specified time interval was not performed on all participants, leading to the exclusion of 148 participants from the results; this increases the risk of attrition bias. Withdrawals were stated in eleven studies (Azziz 1993; Canis 2014; Diamond 1996; Greenblatt 1993; Haney 1995; Keckstein 1996; Li 1994; Myomectomy ASG 1995; Saravelos 1996; Takeuchi 2005; Tinelli 2011 ), and three studies did not state withdrawals (Franklin 1995; Nordic APSG 1995; Sekiba 1992) ; in five studies, no dropouts were reported (Mais 1995a; Mais 1995b; Takeuchi 2005; van Geldorp 1994; Wallweiner 1998 ).No studies with dropouts performed an ITT analysis.A total of six participants from all studies were reported to have been unable to undergo second-look laparoscopy because of pregnancy. Two studies were rated as high risk (Li 1994; Nordic APSG 1995) , and the other 17 studies were rated as unclear risk.The Nordic study reported larger numbers of participants randomly assigned Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews in meeting abstracts before the study was published in a journal (Nordic APSG 1995) .The explanation for this discrepancy was that some participants who did not meet inclusion criteria were recruited and were not included in the final analysis (personal communication, Wiseman 1999).In the United Kingdom, centres other than She ield were randomly assigning participants in a study of oxidised regenerated cellulose versus no treatment in the early 1990s (personal communication, A Watson), but the data have never been published (Li 1994) .Attempts to identify these data by contacting investigators and the sponsoring company (Ethicon, Bridgewater, New Jersey, USA) have proved fruitless thus far.In van Geldorp 1994, another centre was recruiting participants (investigator: Trimbos-Kemper, The Netherlands), but these results have been reported only briefly in a review (Wiseman 1999).Data regarding the use of oxidised regenerated cellulose must be interpreted with caution because of the high risk of bias. Additional information was sought from some study authors; at the time of this writing, six replies had been received (Azziz 1993; Franklin 1995; Keckstein 1996; Myomectomy ASG 1995; Saravelos 1996; van Geldorp 1994) . Haney 1995 reported statistically significant reductions in the adhesion score, but it is not clear whether these analyses took account of the within-participant design.It should be noted that the incidence of adhesions in the oxidised regenerated cellulose arm of the trial is greater than would be expected from the RCTs of oxidised regenerated cellulose versus no barrier agent.As it was not clear from the publication whether the surgeon was unblinded at the time of the second-look laparoscopy, this result should be treated with some caution. Of the 10 studies using a within-participant design and reporting adhesion formation, only three presented and analysed matched data appropriately (Azziz 1993; Saravelos 1996; Sekiba 1992) .Appropriate data were extracted from the reports of two others (Franklin 1995; Haney 1995) , which were incorrectly analysed in the original.See Methods section for a full description.One further study failed to present comparative data and was excluded from all analyses (Greenblatt 1993). See: Summary of findings for the main comparison Analysis 1 -Oxidised regenerated cellulose vs no treatment at laparoscopy for adhesion prevention a er gynaecological surgery; Summary of findings 2 Analysis 2 -Oxidised regenerated cellulose vs no treatment at laparotomy for adhesion prevention a er gynaecological surgery; Summary of findings 3 Analysis 4 -Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene vs oxidised regenerated cellulose for adhesion prevention a er gynaecological surgery; Summary of findings 4 Analysis 7 -Collagen membrane with polyethylene glycol and glycerol vs Ringer\\'s lactate No studies reported either of our primary outcomes (pelvic pain and live birth). (Analysis 1.1; Summary of findings for the main comparison) This was not assessed by any study. This was not assessed by any study. This was not assessed by any study. Six trials reported this outcome.Three reported de novo adhesion formation (Mais 1995b; Saravelos 1996; Tinelli 2011), and three reported re-formation of adhesions following adhesiolysis (Keckstein 1996; Mais 1995a; Wallweiner 1998); Keckstein 1996 reported both de novo and re-formation adhesions and was therefore included with the other studies reporting re-formed adhesions. We are uncertain whether the use of oxidised regenerated cellulose reduced the incidence of de novo adhesions when compared with no treatment at second-look laparoscopy (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.83, 3 trials, 360 participants; I = 75%; very low-quality evidence).This evidence would suggest that among women with a 48% chance of developing de novo adhesions with no treatment, the incidence of de novo adhesions using oxidised regenerated cellulose will be between 22% and 44%. No clear explanation was provided for the high heterogeneity in this analysis (I = 75%).However, it is possible that the small number of participants within the included studies may partially account for it.Di erences in operative procedure were observed between studies, as were di erences in wrapping and use of oxidised regenerated cellulose (Saravelos 1996).It is unclear, however, whether these di erences can account for the very high level of heterogeneity observed in these studies. We are also uncertain whether the use of oxidised regenerated cellulose reduced the incidence of re-formed (or mixed) of adhesions (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.41, 3 trials, 100 participants; I = 36%; very low-quality evidence).This evidence would suggest that among women with a 75% chance of developing re-formed (or mixed) adhesions with no treatment, the incidence of adhesion formation using oxidised regenerated cellulose will be between 18% and 55%.

This was not assessed by any study. This was not assessed by any study. Tinelli 2011 reported the incidence of fever within 48 hours as 6.5% to 12.5% of cases; this was likely to be secondary to surgery rather than to use of the barrier agent.Otherwise, no adverse outcomes were identified among the 236 participants receiving the intervention across studies (Keckstein 1996; Mais 1995a; Mais 1995b; Saravelos 1996; Tinelli 2011; Wallweiner 1998) . (Analysis 2.1; Summary of findings 2) This was not assessed by any study. This was not assessed by any study. This was not assessed by any study. Six trials reported on re-formation of adhesions following laparotomy for adhesiolysis - Azziz 1993 , Li 1994 , Nordic APSG 1995 , Sekiba 1992 -and ovarian surgery -Franklin 1995 , van Geldorp 1994. Use of oxidised regenerated cellulose may have resulted in a reduction in the incidence of re-formation adhesions compared with no treatment (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.55, 6 trials, 554 participants; I = 41%; low-quality evidence).This suggests that among women with a 75% chance of adhesion re-formation with no treatment, the incidence of adhesion re-formation using oxidised regenerated cellulose will be between 45% and 62%. We are uncertain whether oxidised regenerated cellulose a ected the formation of de novo adhesions following laparotomy (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.25, 1 trial, 271 participants; very low-quality evidence).This suggests that among women with a 48% chance of developing de novo adhesions with no treatment, the incidence of de novo adhesions using oxidised regenerated cellulose will be between 28% and 54%.

This was not assessed by any study. This was not assessed by any study. In Azziz 1993, three adverse events occurred (atelectasis, postoperative ileus, fever and abdominal pain), and in van Geldorp 1994, a decrease in haemoglobin was reported.These adverse e ects are related to the surgery rather than to the barrier agent.Otherwise, no adverse outcomes related to the agent were identified among 225 participants receiving the intervention across five studies (Azziz 1993; Franklin 1995; Nordic APSG 1995; Tinelli 2011; van Geldorp 1994) .Two studies did not report on adverse outcomes (Li 1994; Sekiba 1992 ). (Analysis 3.1) This was not assessed by any study. This was not assessed by any study. This was not assessed by any study. Only one trial reported this comparison and described a reduction in new adhesion formation among women undergoing myomectomy at laparotomy (Myomectomy ASG 1995) .Use of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene may have resulted in a reduction in new adhesion formation (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.94, 1 trial, 42 participants; low-quality evidence).This result was obtained by assuming the outcome least favourable to expanded polytetrafluoroethylene that was compatible with reported results.

(Analysis 4.1 and Analysis 4.2; Summary of findings 3) This was not assessed by any study. This was not assessed by any study. We are uncertain whether the use of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene a ected the adhesion score at SLL when compared with oxidised regenerated cellulose (MD -3.79, 95% CI -5.12 to -2.46, 1 study, 62 participants; very low-quality evidence). One trial reported no evidence of a di erence in the formation of de novo adhesions following myomectomy at laparoscopy (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.26 to 3.41, 1 trial, 38 participants; very low-quality evidence) (Korell 1994) .This suggests that among women with a 15% chance of developing de novo adhesions with oxidised regenerated cellulose, the incidence of de novo adhesions using expanded polytetrafluoroethylene will be between 5% and 38%. One trial reported this comparison for a reduction in reformation of adhesions among women undergoing adhesiolysis at laparotomy (Haney 1995).We are uncertain whether the use of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene was associated with a reduction in adhesion re-formation (OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.80, 1 trial, 23 participants; very low-quality evidence).This suggests that among women with a 57% chance of adhesion re-formation with oxidised regenerated cellulose, the incidence of adhesion re-formation using expanded polytetrafluoroethylene will be between 3% and 52%.This finding was sensitive to choice of e ect measure, just ceasing to show a reduction in adhesions when the risk of re-formed adhesions was analysed using risk ratio (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.01). This was not assessed by any study. This was not assessed by any study. This was not assessed by any study. This was not assessed by any study. Participants in Haney 1995 experienced no adverse e ects (three were treated with expanded polytetrafluoroethylene during surgery; nine were treated with oxidised regenerated cellulose).One study did not report whether adverse outcomes occurred (Korell 1994). (Analysis 5.1) This was not assessed by any study. This was not assessed by any study. Diamond 1996 reported adhesion severity score with use of sodium hyaluronate with carboxymethylcellulose in comparison with no treatment, using a non-validated scoring method out of four.This showed that the use of sodium hyaluronate with carboxymethylcellulose probably resulted in a reduced adhesion severity score when compared with no treatment (MD 0.49, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.45, 1 trial, 127 participants; moderate-quality evidence; Analysis 5.1). Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. One study assessed fibrin sheet versus no treatment at laparoscopic myomectomy.Study authors reported no di erence in adhesion grading, using a non-validated scoring method out of four (MD 0.14, 95% CI -0.67 to 0.39, 1 trial, 48 participants; very lowquality evidence). Only one study assessed fibrin sheet versus no treatment at laparoscopic myomectomy (Takeuchi 2005) .Study authors reported the frequency and severity of postoperative adhesions.No evidence was found of di erences between groups in the incidence of postoperative adhesions per participant (OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.42 to 3.41, 1 study, 62 participants; very low-quality evidence).

One study assessed collagen membrane with polyethylene glycol plus glycerol versus Ringer\\'s lactate in myomectomy at laparotomy (Canis 2014).The study reports median rather than mean mAFS scores at SLL; however results appear to demonstrate no di erence between groups (0.8 vs 1.2, 1 trial, 47 participants; very low-quality evidence). One study investigated the incidence of de novo adhesions with collagen membrane with polyethylene glycol plus glycerol versus Ringer\\'s lactate in myomectomy at laparotomy (Canis 2014).This suggests that there may have been a lower incidence of adhesions at SLL in the collagen membrane with polyethylene glycol plus glycerol group when compared with the control group (OR 0.04, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.77, 1 trial, 47 participants; low-quality evidence) (Analysis 7.1).This suggests that among women with a 48% chance of developing de novo adhesions with no barrier, the incidence of de novo adhesions using collagen membrane with polyethylene glycerol plus glycol will be between 0% and 42%. See Figure 6 . One study assessed collagen membrane with polyethylene glycol and glycerol versus Ringer\\'s lactate in myomectomy at laparotomy (Canis 2014).This suggests that collagen membrane with polyethylene glycol and glycerol may have improved clinical pregnancy rate at three-year follow-up when compared with the control (OR 5.69, 95% CI 1.38 to 23.48, 1 trial, 39 participants; lowquality evidence; Analysis 7.3).This suggests that among women with a 23% chance of becoming clinically pregnant with no barrier, Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews the incidence of clinical pregnancy using collagen membrane with polyethylene glycol plus glycerol will be between 29% and 87%. This was not assessed by any study. One study assessed collagen membrane with polyethylene glycol plus glycerol versus Ringer\\'s lactate in myomectomy at laparotomy (Canis 2014).At three-year follow-up of 39 participants, no ectopic pregnancies were reported in either study group (Analysis 7.4). This was not assessed by any study. Canis 2014 reported four participants in the collagen membrane with polyethylene glycol plus glycerol group who were hospitalised due to adverse events: one due to intra-abdominal bleeding, one with anaemia due to preoperative and postoperative bleeding, one with a parietal haematoma, and one with abdominal pain and digestive disorders. Three studies reported an unclear randomisation procedure (Greenblatt 1993; Haney 1995; Wallweiner 1998) (although additional information has been requested).Excluding these studies from the analyses did not substantially a ect findings. Azziz 1993 reported a large number of dropouts (64/198), but excluding this study from the analyses did not a ect findings. In other sensitivity analyses, use of a random-e ects model, or of risk ratio rather than odds ratio, did not substantially change findings for any outcomes, except that in the comparison of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene versus oxidised regenerated cellulose (Analysis 4.2), the confidence interval crossed the line of no e ect when a risk ratio rather than an odds ratio was calculated (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.01). Insu icient studies were included in any analysis to permit construction of a funnel plot, so we were unable to formally assess publication bias. \\'Summary of findings\\' tables for Analyses 3, 5, and 6 have not been included in this update of the review but can be found in the last published version (Ahmad 2015). Review authors identified that no studies reported our primary outcomes of pelvic pain and live birth rate; therefore any conclusions discussed below relate solely to our secondary outcomes. We found evidence that use of oxidised regenerated cellulose may reduce the incidence of re-formation of adhesions at laparotomy (low-quality evidence).We are uncertain whether use of oxidised regenerated cellulose reduces de novo adhesion formation or adhesion re-formation at laparoscopy.We are also uncertain whether the use of oxidised regenerated cellulose reduces de novo adhesion formation at laparotomy. We are uncertain whether polytetrafluoroethylene reduces adhesion formation when compared with oxidised regenerated cellulose. One study suggested that use of sodium hyaluronate with carboxymethylcellulose probably reduces adhesion formation a er laparoscopy (moderate-quality evidence). We are uncertain whether use of fibrin sheets reduces the formation of adhesions. One study suggested that use of a collagen membrane with polyethylene glycol plus glycerol may reduce the formation of adhesions at laparotomy (low-quality evidence).Based on evidence from the same study, we are uncertain whether collagen membrane with polyethylene glycol and glycerol improved clinical pregnancy rate (low-quality evidence). Most gynaecological surgery is associated with risk of pelvic adhesions.Clinical consequences of adhesions include pain, subfertility, and small-bowel obstruction, as well as complications of subsequent surgery.Minimally invasive techniques such as laparoscopy reduce the risk of de novo adhesion formation but do not eliminate it entirely.Studies included within this review therefore assessed both laparoscopy and laparotomy. This review assessed the e ectiveness of barrier agents in reducing adhesions following conservative gynaecological surgery.As noted above, pharmacological and fluid agents are assessed in a separate Cochrane Review. Unfortunately, no studies in this review reported live birth rate or pelvic pain as a primary outcome but instead focused on extent of adhesion formation by incidence or by score.However, only six studies investigated the use of barrier agents in women seeking treatment to improve fertility.None of these studies reported adverse outcomes attributable to use of a barrier agent. The included studies were at unclear risk of bias in most domains.The most common limitation was failure to report su icient details of study methods.Studies were at high risk of bias related to attrition rates (four studies), selective reporting (two studies), and lack of blinding (one study).Reporting of adverse e ects was inadequate.We were unable to formally assess the risk of publication bias.However, we note that 13 studies reported sponsorship, 12 of which were sponsored by companies that manufactured adhesion agents.Furthermore, evidence suggests that unpublished data may exist regarding oxidised regenerated cellulose.Specifically, centres in the United Kingdom were known to be randomly assigning participants for a study in 1990 (personal communication, AW), although only results from She ield were identified by our search (Li 1994) .Evidence of duplicate publication Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews of data may contribute to increased risk of publication bias (Haney 1995) . Clinical heterogeneity between studies was observed, with di erences in surgical technique and variable timing of secondlook laparoscopy ranging from 23 days to 2.5 years.Considerable statistical heterogeneity was observed in the comparison of oxidised regenerated cellulose versus no treatment at laparoscopy (I = 75%), for which no clear explanation was provided. We graded the overall quality of the evidence using GRADE methods.The quality ranged from very low to moderate but was low or very low for most comparisons.The main limitations were imprecision and poor reporting of study methods.See Summary of findings for the main comparison, Summary of findings 2, Summary of findings 3, and Summary of findings 4. Summary of findings tables for Analyses 3, 5, and 6 have not been included in this update and can be found in the last published version (Ahmad 2015). The review authors made every e ort to identify all studies that should be considered for inclusion.However, it remains possible that some errors were made in the review process and some relevant publications may have been missed. Since the time of the previous review, necessary details required for inclusion in Cochrane Reviews have increased substantially.Although all previously included studies were reassessed for bias, some information was required from the study authors themselves, and attempts were made to contact them. Duplicate publication of data and existence of unreported data create a risk of bias.This is reflected in the GRADE rating of very low for oxidised regenerated cellulose versus no comparison at laparoscopy.This was o en di icult to establish because the data were presented as abstracts at meetings (o en by di erent study authors).For example, Haney 1995 had four abstract publications, and Keckstein 1996 had two abstract publications. A review published in 2010 concludes that the \"evidence is not adequate for definite conclusions to be drawn, either in terms of e icacy or in terms of safety\" with regard to anti-adhesion agents in gynaecological surgery (Pados 2010).This is consistent with the findings of this review, which has found very little evidence on clinically relevant endpoints.Furthermore, the generally low GRADE evidence quality ratings given to most of the outcomes in this review show how, on our assessment, considerable uncertainty remains regarding use of these agents for improving patient outcomes. The guidelines of the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada on use of adhesion agents in gynaecological surgery are consistent with the notion that evidence on the e ects of barrier agents on long-term clinical outcomes such as chronic pelvic pain and infertility is insu icient (Robertson 2010).These guidelines also state, \"Oxidized regenerated cellulose adhesion barrier is associated with reduced incidence of pelvic adhesion formation at both laparoscopy and laparotomy when complete haemostasis is achieved.\"This information is somewhat consistent with that reported in this review, which found that oxidised regenerated cellulose may reduce the re-formation of adhesions at laparotomy.However, this review determined that the quality of evidence obtained ranged from very low to low; and due to poor quality of evidence we were uncertain of the benefits of oxidised regenerated cellulose at laparoscopy. The guidelines of the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada also state, \"Polytetrafluoroethylene barrier is more e ective than no barrier or oxidized regenerated cellulose in preventing adhesion formation\" (Robertson 2010).This again is partially consistent with our conclusions, as we identified one study suggesting that use of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene may reduce formation of de novo adhesions at laparoscopy.However, we rated the quality of evidence as low.We also found one trial that suggested superiority of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene over oxidised regenerated cellulose for incidence of re-formation adhesions.We deemed this evidence to be of very low quality, as this was a very small, unblinded, privately funded study, and we are therefore uncertain whether polytetrafluoroethylene reduces adhesion formation when compared with oxidised regenerated cellulose. Finally, Robertson 2010 states, \"Chemically modified sodium hyaluronate/carboxymethylcellulose is e ective in preventing adhesion formation, especially following myomectomies,\" although researchers warned that these results should be interpreted with caution on the basis of comments provided in the previous version of this review.Our updated review also agrees with this conclusion. We found no evidence on the e ects of barrier agents used during pelvic surgery on either pain or fertility outcomes in women of reproductive age, as no studies were identified that reported these outcomes. Low-quality evidence suggests that oxidised regenerated cellulose, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, sodium hyaluronate with carboxymethylcellulose, and collagen membrane with polyethylene glycol plus glycerol may all be more e ective than no treatment in reducing the incidence of adhesion formation following pelvic surgery.We found no conclusive evidence on the relative e ectiveness of these interventions.We are uncertain whether use of a fibrin sheet is more e ective than no treatment. No adverse events directly attributed to the adhesion agents were reported.The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate.The most common limitations were imprecision and poor reporting of study methods.Most studies were commercially funded, and publication bias could not be ruled out. Further high-quality studies with improved blinding of surgeons/ outcome assessors, reduced selective reporting, and use of intention-to-treat analyses are required.Research should focus on the e ects of barrier agents on clinical outcomes, with emphasis on fertility outcomes among women trying to conceive.Future studies should include women as the unit of randomisation, live birth and Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health.

Search methods\\nBody Text: ABSTRACT Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) coupled with in vitro fertilisation (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) was one of the major advances in the treatment of subfertility in the second half of the 20th century.One aspect of COH-IVF or ICSI that requires attention is the occurrence of a luteinizing hormone (LH) surge which may occur prematurely, before the leading follicle reaches the optimum diameter for triggering ovulation.Such premature LH surges prevent e ective induction of multiple follicular maturation patterns for a significant number of women. Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRH agonists) have played an important role in reducing the incidence of premature LH surges by reversibly blocking pituitary gonadotrophin secretion.As a result, the rates of cancellation of assisted conception cycles are decreased and pregnancy rates increased (Albano 1996; Hughes 1992).However, the use of GnRH agonists is not without disadvantages.Even though the standard long-course GnRH agonist protocol proved to be the most e icacious protocol (Daya 2000) for the use of GnRH agonists, it requires two to three weeks for desensitisation, with relatively high costs due to an increased requirement for gonadotrophin injections, and the need for hormonal and ultrasonographic measurements (Olivennes 1994). A common complication associated with ovarian stimulation with exogenous gonadotrophins is ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) (Mathur 2007).It usually occurs following a LH surge or a er exposure to human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) (Mozes 1965) .Most cases of OHSS are mild with few or no clinical consequences.However, severe cases occur occasionally with serious morbidity and mortalities (Delvigne 2002).Gonadotrophinreleasing hormone analogues (GnRH agonists and antagonists) stabilise the luteal phase thereby preventing premature LH surges and reducing the risk of OHSS. In 1999, gonadotrophin-releasing hormone antagonists (GnRH antagonist) were introduced to the market to prevent LH surge, and it was assumed that GnRH antagonists might be a more patientfriendly protocol than the mid-luteal GnRH agonist protocol.GnRH antagonists cause immediate, reversible and dose-related inhibition of gonadotrophin release by competitive blockade of the GnRH receptors in the pituitary gland, and therefore treatment can be restricted to those days when a premature LH surge is likely to occur (Duijkers 1998; Felberbaum 1995; Huirne 2007) . The first generation of GnRH antagonists were associated with allergic side-e ects due to an induced histamine release, which hampered the clinical development of these compounds.Third generation GnRH antagonists such as ganirelix (NV Organon, Oss, the Netherlands) and cetrorelix (ASTA-Medica, Frankfurt am Main, Germany) have resolved these issues and are approved for clinical use (Olivennes 1998). Two approaches have emerged in GnRH antagonist administration; the single-dose protocol, in which one injection of GnRH antagonist (Cetrotide® 3 mg, Merck SeronoSA., Geneva, Switzerland ) is administered in the late phase of ovarian stimulation and the multiple-dose regimen, in which 0.25 µg of cetrorelix or ganirelix is administered daily from stimulation day 6 onwards (fixed regimen).A flexible regimen based on the follicular size, has since been introduced to minimise the number and duration of GnRH antagonist injections (Huirne 2007). In a natural ovulatory cycle, ovulation, the release of the dominant follicle from the ovary, usually occurs about 36 hours a er LH surge.In women undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) during assisted reproductive technology (ART), certain agents are usually administered to mimic the natural LH surge.Ultrasound scan and blood oestrogen levels are used to determine the day on which to administer the triggering agents.Ovulation triggering agents include hCG and GnRH agonist.These agents have di erent modes of action and their use might, therefore, di erentially influence the e ectiveness of GnRH antagonists. Applying GnRH antagonists for pituitary desensitisation during COH is expected to result in a dramatic reduction in the duration of GnRH analogue treatment and to reduce the amount of gonadotrophin needed for stimulation as compared with the long agonist protocol.Other potential benefits include a lower risk of developing severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) and avoidance of oestrogen deprivation symptoms (for example hot flushes, sleep disturbances, headaches) frequently observed in the pre-stimulation phase of a long agonist protocol.Whether the previously mentioned benefits justify a change in routine treatment from the standard long-course GnRH agonist protocol to the GnRH antagonist regimen depends on whether the clinical outcomes using these protocols are similar. The first Cochrane review on this topic was published in 2001 and was updated in 2006 and 2011.As further RCTs have been published, this is a further update of the evidence on the comparative e ectiveness of GnRH antagonists versus GnRH agonists in women undergoing COH-IVF or ICSI, with respect to reducing the risk of OHSS and cycle cancellation while maintaining the live birth rate. To evaluate the e ectiveness and safety of gonadotrophinreleasing hormone (GnRH) antagonists compared with the standard long protocol of GnRH agonists for controlled ovarian hyperstimulation in assisted conception cycles. Only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a parallel design were eligible for inclusion.Quasi-randomised trials were not included (e.g.studies with evidence of inadequate sequence generation such as alternate days, patient numbers) as they are associated with a high risk of bias.If cross-over studies, with cross-over occurring between cycles, were available, we would have included only the first cycle, before the cross-over.

We searched for all published and unpublished RCTs of GnRH antagonist versus the long-course GnRH agonist protocol in women undergoing COH-IVF or ICSI using the following search strategy, without language restriction and in consultation with the Gynaecology and Fertility Group (CGF) (formerly known as Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group (MDSG)) Information Specialist.We performed the most recent searches on 28 April 2015. The following electronic databases, trial registers and websites were searched (from their inception). • Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group (MDSG) Specialised Register (updated search from 2010 to 28 April 2015) (Appendix 1). We also searched the reference lists of all known primary studies, review articles, citation lists of relevant publications, abstracts of major scientific meetings (for example of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) and American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM)).We contacted known experts and personal contacts regarding any unpublished materials. In addition, we handsearched appropriate journals.The list of journals is in the CGF Module, which can be found in The Cochrane Library under BROWSE -\\'By Review Group\\' -\\'Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group\\' -then \\'about this group\\' at the top of this page.We liaised with the CGF Information Specialist to avoid duplication of handsearching. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. A er an initial screen of titles and abstracts retrieved by the search, we retrieved the full texts of all potentially eligible studies.Two review authors (RA and JB) independently examined these full-text articles for compliance with the inclusion criteria and selected studies eligible for inclusion in the review.We contacted study investigators as required, to clarify study eligibility.We resolved disagreements as to study eligibility by discussion or by involving a third review author (MAY).We documented the selection process with a \"PRISMA\" flow chart (Figure 1  Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011a).Where studies had multiple publications the review authors collated multiple reports of the same study, so that each study rather than each report was the unit of interest in the review, and such studies would have a single study ID with multiple references.We contacted trial authors to request additional information or data.We also received a response from the sponsoring pharmaceutical companies. Three authors (RA, JB and WSL) independently assessed the risk of bias of the included trials using The Cochrane \\'Risk of bias\\' (RoB) tool (Higgins 2011b).The domains assessed were: (1) sequence generation (for example; was the method used for allocation sequence adequately described?);(2) allocation concealment (for example, was allocation adequately concealed?);(3) blinding of participants, personnel and outcome assessors (for example; was knowledge of the allocated intervention adequately prevented during the study?);(4) incomplete outcome data (for example, were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed?);(5) selective outcome reporting (for example, were reports of the study free of suggestion of selective outcome reporting?);and (6) other sources of bias (for example, was the study apparently free of other problems that could put it at a high risk of bias?).Other potential sources of bias included baseline imbalances, source of funding, early stopping for benefit, and appropriateness of cross-over design.We resolved disagreements by discussion or by consulting a fourth review author.We described all judgements fully and presented the conclusions in the \\'Risk of bias\\' table (see the Characteristics of included studies table), which was incorporated into the interpretation of review findings by means of sensitivity analyses (see below). With respect to selective reporting, we sought published protocols and compared the outcomes between the protocol and the final published study, but the searches did not yield published protocols of any of the included studies.We took care to search for within-trial selective reporting, such as non-reporting of obvious outcomes, or reporting them in insu icient detail to allow for inclusion.Where identified studies failed to report the primary outcomes of live birth and OHSS but did report interim outcomes such as pregnancy, we undertook informal assessment as to whether the interim values (e.g.pregnancy rates) were similar to those reported in studies that also reported live birth. We only reported dichotomous data (e.g.live birth rates) in this review and we used the numbers of events in the control and intervention groups of each study to calculate Mantel-Haenszel odds ratios (ORs).We reversed the direction of e ect of individual studies, if required, to ensure consistency across trials.We presented 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for all outcomes.Where data to calculate ORs were not available, we utilised the most detailed numerical data available that facilitated similar analyses of included studies (e.g.test statistics, P values).We compared the magnitude and direction of e ect reported by studies with how they were presented in the review, taking account of legitimate di erences (Deeks 2011). The primary analysis was per woman randomised.We also included per clinical pregnancy data for miscarriage.we contacted authors of studies that did not allow valid analysis of data (e.g.\\'per cycle\\' data) and requested \\'per woman\\' data.If no \\'per woman\\' data was provided a er contact, we did not include such studies in metaanalyses. We analysed the data on an intention-to-treat basis as far as possible and made attempts to obtain missing data from the original trialists.Initially, we planned to undertake imputation of individual values for the primary outcomes if we were unable to obtain missing data from the original trialists but no data imputation was undertaken in the end and we analysed only the available data. We considered whether the clinical and methodological characteristics of the included studies were su iciently similar for meta-analysis to provide a clinically meaningful summary.We assessed statistical heterogeneity by the measure of the I 2 statistic (Higgins 2003).We took an I 2 statistic measurement greater than 50% to indicate substantial heterogeneity (Deeks 2011). In view of the di iculty of detecting and correcting for publication bias and other reporting biases, the review authors aimed to minimise their potential impact by ensuring a comprehensive search for eligible studies and by being alert for duplication of data.We used a funnel plot to explore the possibility of small study e ects (a tendency for estimates of the intervention e ect to be more beneficial in smaller studies) (Egger 1997). Where the studies were su iciently similar, we combined the data using a fixed-e ect analysis (on the assumption that the underlying e ect size was the same for all the trials in the analysis) comparing GnRH antagonist versus long course GnRH agonist. An increase in the odds of a particular outcome that were likely to be beneficial (e.g.live birth) or detrimental (e.g.adverse e ects), were displayed graphically in the meta-analyses to the right of the centre-line and a decrease in the odds of an outcome to the le of the centre-line. All analyses were performed using Review Manager so ware (RevMan) (RevMan 2014). Where there were su icient data we performed subgroup analyses for the following variables, for live birth and pregnancy outcomes. • Triggering agent used for oocyte maturation (hCG, GnRH agonist, mixed (hCG/GnRH agonist) or unknown agent) • Minimal or standard level of stimulation Where we detected substantial heterogeneity, we explored possible explanations in sensitivity analyses.We took any Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews statistical heterogeneity into account when interpreting the results, especially where there was any variation in the direction of e ect. We conducted sensitivity analyses for LBR and OPR to determine whether the conclusions were robust to arbitrary decisions made regarding the eligibility and analysis (Moher 1999).These analyses included consideration of whether the review conclusions would have di ered if: • a random-e ects model had been adopted; • the summary e ect measure was risk ratio rather than odds ratio. We prepared a \\'Summary of findings\\' table using GRADEpro Guideline Development Tool (GRADEpro GDT 2015) .This table evaluated the overall quality of the body of evidence for all review outcomes (live birth, OHSS, ongoing pregnancy, clinical pregnancy, miscarriage and cycle cancellation), using GRADE criteria (study limitations (i.e.risk of bias), consistency of e ect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias).Judgements about evidence quality (high, unclear (moderate) or low) were justified, documented, and incorporated into reporting of results for each outcome (Summary of findings for the main comparison). See the table \\'Characteristics of included studies\\'. We retrieved 479 records a er removal of duplicates, excluded 399 as ineligible, and assessed 80 full-text articles.Of these, we excluded 51 and included 28 studies (29 reports).Seventythree randomised controlled studies (84 reports), involving 12,212 randomised women, met the inclusion criteria and were fully reviewed (Characteristics of included studies) (See Figure 1 for details of this process). • Twelve studies were multi-centre (  For the risk of bias (ROB) of the included trials, please see Figure 2 and Figure 3 .

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews • We examined blinding with regard to who was blinded in the trials.We looked for all levels of blinding and categorised them as follows: (i) However, some of the outcome measures such as live birth were objectively assessed and non-blinding of study outcome assessors was not likely to have a ected their measurement. We judged thirty-seven of the included studies as being at low risk of bias in this domain, because they reported that there were no losses to follow up, proportions of withdrawals and reasons for withdrawals were balanced in both treatment groups, or women were analysed on the basis of intention-to-treat, where all women randomised were included in the final analysis whether or not they completed treatment.We judged the remaining studies either as unclear (where studies reported insu icient information with regard to attrition) or high risk of bias (where proportions of and reasons for withdrawals were not balanced between the two treatment groups and not all participants were included in the final analysis). Although the protocols of the included studies were not available for assessment, we scrutinised the methods section for prespecified outcome measures.Most of the included studies were rated as low risk of bias in this domain as they pre-specified the outcomes on which data were reported in the methods section.The remaining studies were judged to be either at unclear risk, where there was insu icient information to make conclusive judgements, or low risk, where it was clear that they engaged in selective outcome reporting. We found no potential sources of within-study bias in most of the included studies as the baseline characteristics were similar between the treatment groups and were, therefore, rated to be at low risk of bias.The remaining studies were rated either as unclear risk, where there was insu icient information to arrive at a judgement, or high risk where there was evidence of significant di erences in demographic characteristics between the treatment groups.

One trial did not report the triggering agent used for ovarian maturation in 404 women.There was no evidence of a di erence in live birth rate between GnRH antagonist and GnRH agonist treatment groups (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.21). ( Analysis 1.4; Figure 8 ) Thirty-six trials reported ovarian hyperstimulation rates in 7944 women.There was evidence of a lower OHSS rate in women who received GnRH antagonist compared with those were treated with GnRH agonist: 290/4474 (6%) versus 396/3470 (11%) (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.72; I 2 = 31%, moderate quality evidence).The evidence suggested that if the risk of OHSS following GnRH agonist is assumed to be 11%, the risk following GnRH antagonist would be between 6% and 9%.Twenty trials reported moderate or severe ovarian hyperstimulation rates in 5141 women.There was evidence of a lower rate of moderate or severe OHSS in GnRH antagonist compared with GnRH agonist groups: 97/2971 (3%) versus 155/2170 (7%) (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.69; I 2 = 17%). 1.6 Ongoing pregnancy rate per woman randomised ( Analysis 1.6) Thirty-seven trials reported ongoing pregnancy rates in 8311 women.There was no evidence of a di erence in ongoing pregnancy rate following treatment with GnRH antagonist compared with GnRH agonist (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.01; I 2 = 0%; moderate quality evidence).The evidence suggested that if the chance of ongoing pregnancy following GnRH agonist treatment is assumed to be 29%, the chance following GnRH antagonist treatment would be between 26% and 30%.There was no change in the conclusion on sensitivity analysis using either a random-e ects model (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.01) or RR as a measure of treatment e ect (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.01).

( Analysis 1.8) In a subgroup analysis, 29 studies reported ongoing pregnancy rate in 5170 women in whom hCG was used to trigger oocyte maturation.There was no evidence of a di erence in ongoing pregnancy rate between the two treatment groups (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.08; I 2 = 0%). One study used hCG and GnRH agonist in GnRH antagonist and GnRH agonist groups respectively to trigger oocyte maturation in 66 women.There was no evidence of a di erence in ongoing pregnancy rate between GnRH antagonist and GnRH agonist groups (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.61). In a subgroup analysis, seven trials reported ongoing pregnancy rates in 3075 women in whom the agent used in triggering oocyte maturation was unknown.There was no evidence of a di erence following treatment with GnRH antagonist compared with GnRH agonist (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.03; I 2 = 0%). 1.9 Clinical pregnancy rate per woman randomised ( Analysis 1.9) Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Fi y-four trials reported clinical pregnancy rates in 9959 women . There was evidence of a di erence following GnRH antagonist treatment compared with GnRH agonist treatment with a smaller proportion of women reporting clinical pregnancies in the GnRH antagonist group: 1510/5431 (28%) versus 1365/4528 (30%) (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.00; I 2 = 1%, moderate quality evidence).The evidence suggested that if the chance of clinical pregnancy following GnRH agonist treatment is assumed to be 30%, the chance following GnRH antagonist treatment would be between 27% and 30%.Thirty-four trials reported miscarriage rates in 7082 women. There was no evidence of a di erence following GnRH antagonist treatment compared with GnRH agonist treatment (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.29; I 2 = 0%; moderate quality evidence).The evidence suggested that if the risk of miscarriage following GnRH agonist treatment is assumed to be 5%, the risk following GnRH antagonist treatment would be between 4% and 6%. 1.12 Miscarriage rate per clinical pregnancy rate ( Analysis 1.12) Thirty-four trials reported miscarriage rates per clinical pregnancy rates in 2308 women.There was no evidence of a di erence following treatment with GnRH antagonist compared with GnRH agonist (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.37; I 2 = 0%).. (Analysis 1.13) Nineteen trials reported rates of cycle cancellation due to high risk of OHSS in 4256 women.There was evidence of a di erence in cancellation rates with fewer cycles cancelled in the GnRH antagonist groups compared with the GnRH agonist groups (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.69; I 2 = 0%). Twenty-five trials reported rates of cancellation due to poor ovarian response in 5230 women.There was evidence of a di erence in cycle cancellation rates with more cycles cancelled in GnRH antagonist groups compared with GnRH agonist groups (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.65; I 2 = 68%, moderate quality evidence).The evidence suggested that if the risk of cycle cancellation following GnRH agonist treatment is assumed to be 6%, the risk following GnRH antagonist treatment would be between 7% and 10%.There was evidence of statistical heterogeneity among the trials that contributed data to the pooled e ect estimate, with variations in the direction of e ect estimates of individual trials.On sensitivity analysis using a random-e ects model, there was no evidence of a di erence in cancellation rate between the two treatment groups (OR 1.38, 95% CI 0.82 to 2.31).Thus there is some degree of uncertainty with respect to this outcome, as it is sensitive to the choice of statistical model. The previous version of this systematic review included 45 studies, while this updated version includes 73 RCTs and 12,212 randomised women.To our knowledge this systematic review and metaanalysis represents the most recent and largest amount of evidence comparing the use of GnRH antagonist with long-course GnRH agonist protocols in IVF or ICSI treatment cycles. In this updated version of the review we focused on the e ectiveness and safety of GnRH antagonist compared to GnRH agonist cycles in ART.Regarding e ectiveness, there was no evidence of di erences in live birth rate and ongoing pregnancy rate between GnRH agonist and GnRH antagonist LH peak suppression protocols. With regard to safety, GnRH antagonists substantially reduced the incidence of OHSS.For the overall population from assembled studies, the evidence suggested that, if the risk of OHSS following GnRH agonist is assumed to be 11%, the risk following GnRH antagonist would be between 6% and 9%.In addition, there was evidence of a lower rate of moderate or severe OHSS in women who received the GnRH antagonist protocol compared with those who were treated with the GnRH agonist long protocol.However there was no evidence of a di erence in miscarriage rates per woman randomised between the two treatment protocols.There was no clear picture with respect to cycle cancellation between the two treatment groups.While fewer cycles were cancelled in the GnRH antagonist group due to high risk of OHSS, there is some degree of uncertainty with cancellation due to poor ovarian response, as this outcome was sensitive to the choice of statistical model.In summary, there is moderate quality evidence that the use of GnRH antagonist compared with long-course GnRH agonist protocols is associated with a substantial reduction in OHSS without reducing the likelihood of achieving live birth or ongoing pregnancy. Previous versions of this systematic review showed substantially lower clinical and ongoing pregnancy rates for the GnRH antagonist protocol.Two earlier meta-analyses of studies, comparing fixed and flexible GnRH antagonist protocols directly, demonstrated a trend towards higher pregnancy rates when using the fixed protocol, possibly explained by better LH control (Al-Inany 2005; Kolibianakis 2006).The improved performance of antagonist cycles in the present update cannot be explained by the relative use of fixed protocols however, as relatively few new fixed protocols were included.Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews in antagonist cycles, although the mechanism for such change is still unclear.Further studies are needed to investigate the possible role of LH-instability in the improvement of pregnancy outcomes of GnRH antagonist cycles. Increased favourable pregnancy outcomes with GnRH antagonist treatment may also be the result of an improved learning curve with the relatively new GnRH antagonist over the last 15 years.Extensive experience with GnRH antagonist protocols in large studies, leading to more favourable study outcomes, may have positively influenced pregnancy outcomes of GnRH antagonist cycles.Finally, changes in the use of OCP pretreatment (Griesinger 2008), scheduling of hCG for final oocyte maturation (Kolibianakis 2004; Tremellen 2010; Orvieto 2008) or patient selection (Sbracia 2009) may all have contributed to the optimisation of the use of antagonist cycles in ART.However, the improvement in pregnancy outcomes could also be due to the e ects of potential bias in the included studies.For example, the forest plot (Figure 5 ) suggests a tendency for publication of studies with more favourable outcomes with the possibility of existence of unpublished studies with less favourable outcomes. Previous work on the role of OCP pretreatment in direct comparison studies has indicated that OCP pretreatment leads to a longer duration of stimulation, higher oocyte yield, but reduced ongoing pregnancy rate (Smulders 2010).Also a trend towards lower pregnancy rates when using OCP pretreatment has been observed in a separate meta-analysis (Griesinger 2008).As such, it has been recommended that OCP pretreatment does not seem to be the regimen of choice for GnRH antagonist cycles.In the previous versions of this review, however, a subgroup analysis of studies that used OCP pretreatment revealed no substantial di erence between the agonist and antagonist groups for ongoing or clinical pregnancy rates.The percentage of women receiving OCP pretreatment in the 2011 update was comparable with the preceding version in 2006. Overall, the data demonstrate that GnRH antagonist is useful in women undergoing IVF or ICSI because it substantially reduces the occurrence of OHSS without reducing the chances of achieving live a live birth. A long-course GnRH agonist protocol with maximum ovarian stimulation has been the standard protocol for many decades.However, it is relatively complex and expensive, requires long treatment cycles and intensive monitoring, and leads to an abnormal hormonal environment in women.There is now an eager desire to shi to more patient-friendly, mild ovarian-stimulation regimens in which GnRH antagonist may be a suitable solution because there is evidence to suggest that its use is associated with comparable pregnancy outcomes. A good number of the included studies did not report live birth and OHSS: 12 of the included studies reported data on live birth while only 36 reported data on OHSS.One study used single embryo transfer in the antagonist arm and double embryo transfer in the agonist arm.Some of the outcomes of interest were reported by some of the included studies in such a way that they could not be included in meta-analyses.For example, some of the denominators were reported as \\'per oocyte\\' or \\'per embryo\\' transferred, where the numbers of oocytes or embryos transferred were not equal to the number of women randomised.In some of the included studies, some outcomes were not properly defined making it di icult to categorise such outcomes, for example, \\'pregnancy rate\\' which could either be \\'ongoing\\' or \\'clinical\\' pregnancy.We included a small number of studies because they met the inclusion criteria, although they did not report data on any of the outcomes of interest.With respect to the triggering agent used for oocyte maturation, the majority of the studies either used hCG or did not report the triggering agent used.Thus no comparison could be made between the triggering agents such as hCG versus GnRH agonist. The evidence was of moderate quality using GRADE ratings for live birth, OHSS, ongoing pregnancy, clinical pregnancy, miscarriage and cycle cancellation due to poor ovarian response.The main limitations in the evidence were poor reporting of study methods.For example, a majority of the included studies either did not report the processes involved in random sequence generation and allocation concealment or reported vague and insu icient information on the processes, thereby making it di icult to make conclusive judgements on these domains of risk of bias.Poor reporting also a ected the assessment of other domains of risk of bias with most of them being rated as \\'unclear\\'.For live birth, there was evidence suggestive of the possibility of reporting (publication) bias with small studies more likely to report favourable outcomes for GnRH antagonist. Although comprehensive searches were undertaken to ensure that all eligible studies were identified, it is not impossible that some potentially eligible studies could have been le out. The GnRH antagonist protocol is a short and simple protocol with evidence suggesting a comparable live birth rate and a substantial reduction in the incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome when compared to GnRH agonist long protocol in women undergoing ART. In view of the shortcomings noted in the included studies, especially with regard to the methods of reporting of trial procedures, more properly designed studies in accordance with the CONSORT statement are need to further evaluate the e ectiveness and safety of the GnRH antagonist protocol (Schulz 2010).For example, it would be desirable to have trials with low risk of bias with primary outcomes of live birth and OHSS.In addition, further studies are needed to assess this treatment regimen in poor and high responders.We attempted to subgroup treatment regimens by the ovulation triggering agent but no data were available for a proper analysis, as the majority of the included studies either used hCG or did not specify their triggering agents.This is a potential area to be explored by future research.It is also important to understand why pregnancy outcomes have become progressively more favourable with the use of GnRH antagonists.One possible explanation for this could be a decrease in LH instability.This area should be further investigated.Although not a focus of the current update, the potential e ects of OCP pretreatment should be further investigated. Patient satisfaction surveys should also be undertaken to evaluate their impression about GnRH antagonist treatment regimens.

Oocyte retrieval was performed 30 -36 hrs after hCG administration, followed by IVF or ICSI. No more than three embryos were transferred 2 -3 days after oocyte retrieval. Progesterone for luteal support was given daily (doses and administration form as per usual protocol of the participating centre), starting at the latest on the day of embryo transfer, for two weeks or up to menses The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of each participating centre.All women gave written informed consent.The study was performed according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, and the ICH/Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The study was monitored by uniformly trained Clinical Research Associates of Organon with assistance of a contract research organisation for the clinics in Perth and Adelaide Prior to the start of treatment, a physical and gynaecological examination was performed to exclude any abnormality.Blood samples were taken for routine biochemistry, haematology, and hormonal parameters.A pregnancy test (urinary hCG) was performed.Blood samples for hormone assessments were taken just before the first rFSH injection (treatment day 1) and at least once every two days from day 5/6 of rFSH treatment (in the antagonist groups just before ganirelix injection) up to and including the day of hCG.Serum FSH, LH, estradiol, and progesterone values were determined by means of the automated Wallac AutoDelfia Fluoroimmunoassay system (PerkinElmer Inc., Wellesley MA, USA) at a central laboratory (ABL BV, Assen, The Netherlands).The maximum intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation were 3.3% for FSH, 3.4% for LH, 4.9% for estradiol, and 4.3% for progesterone.To measure follicular development, ultrasonography was performed at least once every two days from day 5/6 of rFSH treatment up to and including the day of hCG. Other parameters assessed were treatment failure (defined as the number of women who did not have an hCG injection or who received an hCG injection because of premature luteinisation), number of LH rises (LH = 10 IU/l), number of oocytes retrieved, number of good quality embryos (grade 1 (defined as Cochrane Library Trusted evidence.

In 2012, approximately 350,000 adverse pregnancy outcomes worldwide were attributed to syphilis, of these 40% were early fetal deaths/stillbirths, 18% neonatal deaths, 13% preterm/lowbirthweight babies and 29% infected infants (Wijesooriya 2016) .The majority of adverse perinatal outcomes (87%) were seen in Africa and Asia.Approximately 66% of all adverse outcomes occurred in women who had attended antenatal care and who were not tested or were not treated for syphilis (Newman 2013) .Syphilis infects 1% or more of antenatal care attendees in over 55 countries (WHO 2016) .The severity of adverse outcomes associated with congenital syphilis is usually determined by the length of the maternal infection as well as the stage of pregnancy; in the early stages, the spirochetaemia (presence of spirochetes in the blood) is higher, therefore fetus infection is more frequent.Mothers with primary syphilis can transmit the infection to the fetus in 70% to 100% of cases, with secondary infection in 90%, and with latent syphilis in 30% (Berman 2004) .Women screened and treated in the first two trimesters of their pregnancy are more likely to have a healthy infant, compared to women screened and treated in the third trimester (odds ratio (OR) 2.24; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.28 to 3.93) (Hawkes 2013) .Thus, diagnosis and treatment of syphilis must be carried out early in the pregnancy. Syphilis testing and treatment can e ectively prevent adverse pregnancy outcomes related to syphilis; neonates who survive with congenital syphilis are at risk of congenital anomalies, active syphilis, and longer-term sequelae, including deafness and neurologic impairment (Gloyd 2001) . In 2007, the World Health Organization (WHO) released a strategy for the elimination of congenital syphilis as a public health problem through reduction of the prevalence of syphilis in pregnant women and the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of syphilis.This strategy rests on four distinct pillars, namely: (1) ensuring sustained political commitment and advocacy; (2) increasing access to, and quality of, maternal and newborn health services; (3) screening of all pregnant women and treatment of all positive cases and their partner; and (4) establishing surveillance, monitoring and evaluation systems.To eliminate mother-to-child transmission of syphilis, countries should test at least 95% of pregnant women for syphilis at the first antenatal control visit (WHO 2007) . The diagnosis of syphilis is suspected by clinical presentation, or by the risk factors of infection.Most patients do not have symptoms or signs at presentation, and the diagnosis has to be made by diagnostic test.The treponemal infection produces an inflammatory response in which the damaged host cells release lipoproteins such as cardiolipins and lecithin, the non-treponemal test detects these substances, but can produce a false-positive reaction with some clinical conditions such as collagen diseases, antiphospholipid syndrome, other treponemical infections (for example, pian, leprosy), as well as pregnancy (Cohen 2013 ).The sensitivity is higher in secondary (100%) and latent syphilis (96% to 98%), but the sensitivity is lower in primary (78% to 86%, darkfield confirmed cases as this was mentioned in (Creegan 2007) , and in late syphilis (71% to 73%).The specificity of the test is 98% in all stages, compared with the Treponema pallidum hemagglutination (TPHA) test (Naidu 2012) .The reports of the non-treponemal test are in dilutions or in titres, the higher the production of antibodies, the higher the titres; a result of 1:8 titres is very suggestive of recent or active infection. People with syphilis develop specific antibodies against treponema.The detection of these antibodies can be made by di erent techniques such as fluorescent agglutination, hemagglutination or chemiluminescence, which comprise the treponemal test, and the more o en used are: the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorbed (FTA-ABS) test, Treponema pallidum particle agglutination (TP-PA) assay, enzyme immunoassay (EIA), and chemiluminescence immunoassay (CIA).These test have a moderate sensitivity in primary syphilis (84% to 96%), and a high sensitivity in the other stages; and they have high specificity (98%) in all stages.The result is either positive or negative (Naidu 2012) . Due to the importance of infection in pregnancy, given the risk of infection to the fetus, all pregnant women are screened for syphilis infection.The traditional algorithm of diagnosis begins with a non-treponemal test, and if this test is positive, the infection is confirmed with a treponemal test (CDC 2014; PAHO 2015; WHO 2007) .As the non-treponemal tests have false-positive results, and low titles have to be confirmed, with a delay in the diagnosis, some authors recommend the reverse algorithm (PAHO 2015) .This strategy consists in first performing the treponemal test, if it is positive, given its high specificity, antibiotic treatment is started and the non-treponemal test is requested to confirm the infection activity (CDC 2008) . The diagnosis of syphilis is made when the pregnant women has clinical signs of infection, such as chancre, skin ulcer, or rash, and the non-treponemal and treponemal syphilis tests are reactive.The most common clinical scenario is the absence of symptoms, in this case the diagnosis of active or recent infection is made when the two tests are positive.In the non-active syphilis or immunological memory, only the treponemal tests are positive.When only the nontreponemal test is positive, it is considered to be a false positive for infection (PAHO 2015) . Treponemal tests require more technology and are more expensive, therefore, they are not available in all healthcare settings (Peeling 2004) .In some countries or healthcare settings, when the diagnosis begins with the non-treponemal test, if the test is positive, the prenatal control personnel will request the treponemal test.However, due to the di iculties mentioned with this test, many patients do not return for the result and the patient is le without the appropriate treatment for the infection (Jafari 2013) .This results in cases of congenital syphilis, which could have been avoided.In low-and middle-income countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America, roughly one out of three women is not tested for syphilis during pregnancy, with wide variations from country to country (WHO 2014). Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. In pregnancy, it is necessary to make a timely diagnosis of all pathologies that a ect the mother or the fetus.Perinatal infections cause severe lesions in the fetus that produce sequelae in neonates.When gestational syphilis is diagnosed and treated early, the fetal morbidity and mortality decrease significantly (Hawkes 2013) . In order to improve the opportunity for diagnosis, rapid diagnosis tests (RDTs) have been developed.These tests consist of a kit, with all the necessary components included, and they can be applied anywhere, by a trained person.The RDT applied at the point of care (POC) has made syphilis testing possible even in remote settings (WHO 2016 B), because they do not need refrigeration or laboratory equipment.The syphilis RDTs use for diagnosis, a drop of blood, that can be obtained by puncture of one finger, and they provide results in 10 to 15 minutes (Jafari 2013) expressed in a qualitative way (positive or negative). The RDTs developed for syphilis are treponemal and non-treponemal.The technology base of the test is inmunochromatographic or agglutinant.A positive treponemic test indicates an old or recent infection.The non-treponemal test indicates an active infection.Studies with RDTs (treponemal and non-treponemal) show a specificity from 94% to more than 99% and a sensitivity between 60% to 100%, depending on the test (Gaydos 2014; Jafari 2013 ).In the prenatal control clinic, it is advisable not to miss the opportunity of treatment of gestational syphilis, therefore in a patient with a positive treponemal test, it is important to start antibiotic treatment as soon as possible (Binnicker 2012) .This strategy could result in over-treatment as a result of false positives due to old infections, but is less dangerous than the secondary risk of not treating the infection in pregnant women (Jafari 2013) .In highprevalence gestational syphilis communities, the combined tests may significantly reduce over-treatment (Greer 2008) .Another test, that is very useful in pregnancy is the HIV/syphilis Duo test, that is a method of qualitative detection of both infections, by inmunochromatography to detect immunoglobulin (Ig) IgG, IgM and IgA antibodies for specific-HIV antigens and the Treponema pallidum recombinant antigen in serum (Bristow 2016; Gaitán-Duarte 2016) . In some settings these RDTs could be more cost-e ective in screening and treating syphilis than laboratory-based testing methods such as the rapid plasma reagin (RPR) or venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) test (Terris-Prestholt 2015).The implementation of rapid testing must be accompanied by quality assurance systems and technical competence (Benzaken 2014) .Currently there are numerous commercial trades for POC tests, being the most commonly used the Abbott Determine, Omega Visitect, Qualpro Syphicheck, Standard Bioline and Trinity Syphilis Health Check (Mabey 2006) In recent meta-analysis the sensitivity of treponemal POC tests varied form 74.26% to 90.04% and specificity from 94.15% to 99.58% (Jafari 2013) .The combined test has a sensitivity of 98.4% when the standard is a non-treponemal test (RPR) greater than 1:8 dilutions, but it has been seen that sensitivity falls to 88% when RPR is negative (Singh 2015) .Nevertheless, these recent analysis are made with studies that use frozen samples with the serologic status already known (STD clinic attendees, female sex workers and antenatal clinic attendees) and a majority used a TP specific reference standard, resulting in high sensitivities and specificities, inducing biases during the process.Our review will include only studies in pregnant women made on the field, with fresh samples (Jafari 2013)  The diagnosis of gestational syphilis, early in pregnancy is very important, in order to prevent congenital syphilis.The majority of pregnant women with syphilis are in the latent stage of infection, so they do not present symptoms or signs.The diagnosis is based on laboratory tests (Cohen 2013) .It is known that prevention of mother-to-child syphilis transmission is feasible, even in low-resource settings.In pregnant women, early screening and detection of syphilis with a rapid treatment for positive patients will prevent transmission to the child (CDC 2008; Taylor 2017 ).Based on this, in 2011 the WHO launched strategies for prevention of congenital syphilis (WHO 2007) .In some places, it is not possible to perform or to wait for the results of a laboratory test, therefore diagnosis depends on the availability of RDTs, and their use at POC helps to improve early detection and they contribute to achieving this goal (Peeling 2010) .The RDT for syphilis can be implemented by clinicians under di erent scenarios regardless of healthcare levels, covering a broad patient spectrum. In prenatal control clinics, the diagnosis of syphilis can be made, beginning with non-treponemal test, and then confirming with the treponemal test.Syphilis is diagnosed, when the two tests are positive.In recent years, some countries have used the inverse algorithm, beginning with the treponemal test, followed by the non-treponemal test to determine the activity of the disease.The RDT is a treponemal test that could be done at the POC, and the results obtained in the same prenatal control visit.A positive treponemal RDT confirms the diagnosis of old or active syphilis and the necessary treatment must be applied.In addition, in the same consultation, the non-treponemal test should be requested, to know the activity of the infection, and then to continue the treatment according to the stage of syphilis (Binnicker 2012) .A negative treponemal RDT, rejects the diagnosis of infection, and control with rapid treponemal test should be continued, each trimester of gestation.When the patient has had one positive treponemal test, the control has to be carried out with a nontreponemal test. The introduction of a rapid test for syphilis in pregnant women, in low-and middle-income countries, has resulted in substantial increases in antenatal syphilis testing (Swartzendruber 2015) .Studies in six countries found significant increases in the proportion of pregnant women screened for syphilis from pre-to postintroduction of screening: Perú from 61% to 100% (Flores 2014) ; Kenya from 18% to 70% (Fleming 2013) ; Uganda from 1.7% to 90.3%; Zambia from 79.9% to 95.6% (Strasser 2012) ; Tanzania 17.8% to 100% (Mabey 2012) ; and Cambodia from 0% to 77% (Delvaux 2011) .In India, a prospective cross-sectional study, showed an increased proportion of pregnant women screened for HIV, syphilis and Hepatitis B from 9% to 96% (Pai 2012) . The WHO sexually transmitted infections (STI) guidelines recommend treatment for early and late congenital syphilis, considering the associated burden and economic costs.Consequently, it is highly desirable to undertake a critical appraisal Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews of the available evidence of the diagnostic accuracy of the di erent RDTs.There is therefore, a need for high-quality systematic reviews to improve the diagnosis of syphilis.This systematic review will facilitate the synthesis of the current evidence, and recognise the strengths and weaknesses, address the uncertainty of the current knowledge and make it possible to assess the e ectiveness and safety of this intervention. The most recent systematic review that evaluates the diagnostic accuracy of the rapid POC tests concluded that immunochromatographic tests such as Determine and Sd Bioline Syphilis 3.0 are acceptable options in antenatal testing for syphilis (Rogozinska 2017) .Nevertheless, there is a need for a systematic review that strengthens these findings.One of the main limitations of Rogozinska 2017 systematic review was the broad limits for the search, wide enough to be less practical.Another limitation was the bivariate analysis applied only in the RPR, weakened by a marked heterogeneity of sensitivity between studies. Knowing the performance, advantages and limitations of the RDTs, could facilitate the generation of a public policy based on testing and treatment in the first two trimesters of all pregnant women and also contribute to goal three of sustainable development goals of the United Nations Organization.This goal is to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being all ages, and includes one point that is to reduce neonatal mortality to at least as low as 12 per 1000 live births, by 2030 (United Nations 2016). To determine the diagnostic accuracy of rapid tests at point of care (POC) for detecting syphilis infection in pregnant women, as verified with the combination of both reactive non-treponemal and treponemal tests as the reference standard. To assess the accuracy of rapid POC testing according to type (non-treponemal and treponemal), infection stage (active versus inactive) and setting (low/middle-income vs high-income countries).In addition, we will to determine the diagnostic accuracy of POC test by brand without realize a formal comparison. We will include accuracy studies.Participants in included studies should have been enrolled under field conditions, prospectively and consecutively or through random sampling.Only studies reporting that all participants received the index test and the reference standard and presenting 2 × 2 data will be eligible for inclusion.We will exclude diagnostic case-control studies, because the diagnosis of infection should not be known, before performing the diagnostic tests. We will include pregnant women, recruited at primary-or secondary-care facilities without previous diagnostic testing, who are attending an outpatient facility, or at the point of labour. Rapid tests at POC from whole blood, serum or plasma, regardless of the type of POC test (non-treponemal or treponemal) or technique (immunochromatographic, agglutination or any other technology). Syphilis at any infection stage (active versus inactive). A combination of both reactive non-treponemal (positive at any titre) and treponemal test (positive result). We will develop a highly-sensitive, systematic search strategy to identify as many relevant accuracy or validity studies, irrespective of their language, and publication status (published, unpublished, in press, and in progress).We will use both electronic searching in bibliographic databases and handsearching, as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011) . The results of all searches will be downloaded and managed using Endnote bibliographic so ware.Duplicate records of the same study will be deleted. We contacted the Information Specialist of the Cochrane Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI) Review Group in order to implement a comprehensive search strategy to capture as many relevant studies as possible in electronic databases.For this purpose, we will use a combination of exploded controlled vocabulary (MeSH, Emtree, DeCS) and free-text terms (considering spelling variants, plurals, synonyms, acronyms and abbreviations) for the index tests (point-of-care test, point of care, point of care testing, point of care devices, point of care diagnostic, point of care laboratory, POC, POCT, rapid test, rapid test device, self testing, self test, patient self testing) and the target condition (syphilis, Treponema pallidum), with field labels, truncation, proximity operators and boolean operators.The search strategies and their results can be found in Appendix 1 (Electronic search strategies).Specifically, we will search the following electronic databases. • MEDLINE, Ovid platform: inception to present. We will attempt to identify additional relevant studies by using of the following methods. • Searching in the Cochrane STI Review Group\\'s Specialized Register, which includes randomised controlled trials (RCTs) Two review authors (NT-M, LV-V) will independently selecting the titles and abstracts of studies retrieved as a result of the search.Disagreements will be resolved through consensus or, if required, by consultation with a third review author (CFG-A).We will retrieve the full text of a study if we have doubts about whether the study should be included or excluded.Two authors (EA-M, JA-G) will review independently the full text of selected articles in order to defined their inclusion.Disagreements will be resolved through consensus or, if required, by consultation with a third review author (CFG-A). We will design a data extraction form.For eligible studies, four review authors (JA-G, NT-M, EA-M, LV-V) will extract data independently using the form.Discrepancies will be resolved through consensus or, if required, by consultation with a fi h review author (CFG-A).The data extraction form will include the following information. • Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews unclear, we will contact the authors of the original reports to request further details. We will assess the quality of included articles by using a modified version of the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool (Whiting 2011).Two review authors (JA-G,EA-M ) will independently perform the quality assessment using the four key domains to assess risk of bias and concerns regarding the applicability to the research question (patient selection, index test, reference standard, and flow-timing domains).We will score the papers as having a \\'low\\', \\'high\\' or \\'unclear\\' risk of bias for each of four domains, and for the patient selection, index test and reference standard applicability.Studies classified at high or unclear risk of bias and/or high concern regarding applicability in at least one domain will be regarded as having low methodological design.The questions for these domains can be found in Appendix 2. In the case of disagreements, di erences will be resolved through consensus or by consultation with a third review author (CFG-A).The results will be presented in graphics according to each study an as a summary of all the studies. We will to assess the accuracy of all POC available test for detecting syphilis infection regardless their type: treponemal or non-treponemal.In this sense we plan to look at their accuracy grouped.On the other hand, because currently there are two common approaches to the diagnosis of syphilis using serological tests: the traditional algorithm (begins the screening with a nontreponemal test and confirms a positive result with a treponemal test) and the reverse algorithm (utilises a treponemal primary screening assay followed by a non-treponemal test if the primary treponemal assay is positive) we plan to report POC test accuracy using as gold standard both approaches grouped by type and sequence. We will summarise diagnostic test accuracy by creating a 2 × 2 table for each study based on information retrieved directly from the papers.Each table will contain false positive, false negative, true positive, and true negative rates.Two review authors (CFG-A, JA-G) will independently enter the data into (Revman 2014 ).Discrepancies will be resolved by consensus or, if required, by consultation with a third review author (EA-M). In the first instance, we will analyse in a descriptive way all data retrieved from the included studies.For this purpose and given that results of the POC are reported qualitatively (positive or negative), we will present the results by plotting their sensitivity and specificity (and their 95% confidence intervals) both in forest plots and in a scatter plot in receiver operating characteristic (ROC) space.For the meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy measures, we will use the bivariate model (Reitsma 2005) .For studies with a common threshold, this model takes into account withinstudy variation and between-study variation and focuses on estimating a summary operating point (i.e. a summary value for sensitivity and specificity).In addition, we will estimate the 95% confidence region and the 95% prediction region around the summary operating point.We will perform these analyses using the command xtmelogit in STATA, according to the licenses available. We will include a \\'Summary of findings\\' table using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach to diagnostic test accuracy (Hsu 2011) , using the template provided in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Diagnostic Test Accuracy (DTA) (Bossuyt 2013 ).We will present this summary table to provide a more accessible perspective of diagnostic information to healthcare providers and other end users. We will explore heterogeneity initially by performing visual inspection of forest plots of sensitivities and specificities and visual examination of the prediction region.We will formally assess the source of heterogeneity by examining di erences in diagnostic accuracy between subgroups of studies.Again, we will use the bivariate method to analyse how the summary estimate of sensitivity and specificity varies according to study level covariate.For this purpose, we will create a factor variable with N categories and will generate an N-1 dummy that will be entered into the bivariate model to test the e ects of covariate on both sensitivity and specificity (Macaskill 2010 ). We will define the sources of heterogeneity a priori and will include the following factors: POC type (non-treponemal and treponemal), infection stage (active versus inactive) and setting (low/middleincome vs high-income countries).In addition, we will to realize a subgroup analyses in order to determine the diagnostic accuracy of POC test by brand, without incurring a formal comparison. We will perform sensitivity analysis for aspects of the review that might a ect the results, such as risk of bias associated with the quality of included trials based on an overall \\'Risk of bias\\' assessment (low versus unclear and high risk of bias) according to QUADAS-2 patient selection, index test, reference standard, and flow-timing domains. We will investigate publication bias if we find 10 or more studies for inclusion in this systematic review.We will investigate reporting bias by using the natural logarithm of the DOR (lnDOR) and plot it against its variance or SE.We will assess asymmetry visually, and if asymmetry is suggested by a visual assessment, we will perform exploratory analyses using Deeks\\' test to investigate the asymmetry and using diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) as a measure of test accuracy (van Enst 2014).

Shats et al. (2) addressed the challenges inherent in treating women with endometriosis who develop a pelvic infection as they shed light on treatment outcomes.They retrospectively evaluated a cohort of 116 patients with known endometriosis from a university-based tertiary care center.The control group included 59 patients with endometriosis (superficial or deep infiltrating lesions) without an endometrioma.In their cohort, patients with an endometrioma and a superimposed PID were less responsive to standard antibiotic treatment and more likely to require surgical intervention.Duration of hospitalization, need for readmission, and evidence of sepsis or positive blood cultures did not increase in patients with endometriomas. A history of infertility was more common in the endometrioma group.For those of us who commonly treat infertility and worry about the potential negative impact of our treatments, it was somewhat reassuring that recent oocyte retrieval, embryo transfer, intrauterine insemination, or hysteroscopy were not associated with an increased risk of severe PID.However, the small number of patients in the subgroup with recent oocyte retrieval and the lack of information regarding whether entry into an endometrioma occurred limit any meaningful change in the dogma to avoid entering an endometrioma, when possible, during egg retrievals. Several potential confounders exist in the cohort.The patients represent a unique subset of women with endometriosis who likely failed initial treatment and were referred to a tertiary \\'\\'Endometriosis Center.\\'\\'Although insertion of an intrauterine device carries only a very small risk of pelvic infection, the study group was less likely to have an intrauterine device in place compared with the control group.The potential for misdiagnosing an endometrioma as a TOA or pelvic abscess is also a potential confounder.The diagnosis of endometriosis was not confirmed surgically in almost half of the patients but instead relied on imaging with ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging.The study included only hospitalized individuals; therefore, generalizability to outpatient treatment of PID is limited. Timely, accurate diagnosis and effective treatment are critical in the treatment of pelvic infections.Although endometriosis muddies the water when caring for patients with PID or a TOA, Shats et al.\\'s (1) work raises awareness of the potential need for surgical intervention.Heightened clinical suspicion is essential to limit both short-term complications of persistent infection and the long-term burden of chronic pelvic pain and infertility.This submission has improved the care of our patients by further demystifying the enigma of endometriosis when pelvic infection is present.\\n\\n==================================================\\n\\nFile: An-interpretable-machine-learning-model-for-predic.grobid.tei.json\\nTitle: An interpretable machine learning model for predicting the optimal day of trigger during ovarian stimulation\\nAuthors: Michael [] Fanton, Veronica [] Nutting, Funmi [] Solano, Paxton [] Maeder-York, Eduardo [] Hariton, Oleksii [] Barash, Louis [] Weckstein, Denny [] Sakkas, Alan [\\'B\\'] Copperman, Kevin [] Loewke\\nAbstract: Objective: To develop an interpretable machine learning model for optimizing the day of trigger in terms of mature oocytes (MII), fertilized oocytes (2PNs), and usable blastocysts.Design: Retrospective study.Setting: A group of three assisted reproductive technology centers in the United States.Patient(s): Patients undergoing autologous in vitro fertilization cycles from 2014 to 2020 (n ¼ 30,278).Intervention(s): None.Main Outcome Measure(s): Average number of MII oocytes, 2PNs, and usable blastocysts.Result(s): A set of interpretable machine learning models were developed using linear regression with follicle counts and estradiol levels.When using the model to make day-by-day predictions of trigger or continuing stimulation, possible early and late triggers were identified in 48.7% and 13.8% of cycles, respectively.After propensity score matching, patients with early triggers had on average 2.3 fewer MII oocytes, 1.8 fewer 2PNs, and 1.0 fewer usable blastocysts compared with matched patients with on-time triggers, and patients with late triggers had on average 2.7 fewer MII oocytes, 2.0 fewer 2PNs, and 0.7 fewer usable blastocysts compared with matched patients with on-time triggers. This study demonstrates that it is possible to develop an interpretable machine learning model for optimizing the day of trigger.Using our model has the potential to improve outcomes for many in vitro fertilization patients.\\nBody Text: T he goal of ovarian stimulation during in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles is to promote multifollicular development to retrieve multiple high-quality oocytes.During ovarian stimulation, physicians make a series of decisions that are critical to the outcome of the cycle, such as which protocol to use and what starting doses of gonadotropins to prescribe.One of the most important decisions is when to give the final trigger injection to induce the final follicular maturation.Triggering too early may not allow the oocytes to reach maturity, whereas triggering too late may result in postmature oocytes as well as an increased risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.The optimal time to administer the trigger injection is a subjective decision and varies widely across practices and physicians, with limited data supporting any strict objective criteria. Numerous studies have explored the relationship between follicle sizes and mature (MII) oocyte outcomes, reporting that follicles that are either too small or too large are less likely to yield MII oocytes (1) (2) (3) (4) .Modeling techniques have been used in retrospective studies to identify follicles of size 12-19 mm on the day of trigger as having the highest likelihood of producing mature oocytes (5) .The ideal way to determine which follicle sizes yield the highest maturation rates would be through individual follicle aspiration; however, such studies are difficult to conduct on a large scale.One study performed individual aspiration of binned follicle group sizes (>18 mm, 16-18 mm, 13-15 mm, 10-12 mm, and <10 mm) and showed that oocyte maturation rates increase with follicle size; however, the point at which follicles reach post-maturity was not established (6) .Although previous studies have established that there is a high correlation between follicle sizes and mature oocyte outcomes, it remains unclear how to apply these findings for optimizing the timing of trigger for an individual patient. In recent years, the field of assisted reproduction has recognized that artificial intelligence techniques can be used to support clinical decision-making during ovarian stimulation, especially with regard to optimizing the day of trigger.One of the earliest studies in this area used machine learning algorithms trained on follicle sizes and other parameters to predict whether a physician would continue stimulation or trigger (7) .A more recent study developed causal machine learning techniques using follicle sizes, estradiol (E2) levels, and patient parameters to recommend continuing stimulation or trigger, with the goal of maximizing the number of fertilized oocytes (2PNs) and blastocysts (8) .A potential limitation of these earlier studies is that they relied on blackbox machine learning algorithms, which are unable to explain the basis for their recommendations.As the IVF field considers the adoption of these promising technologies, there is a question of whether physicians will trust black-box approaches or will prefer interpretable techniques that can explain their reasoning.As such, there is a need for further studies that explore the use of interpretable artificial intelligence for clinical decision support. In this study, we present an interpretable machine learning approach for predicting the optimal day of trigger during ovarian stimulation.Our model uses a set of linear regression models to predict the number of MII oocytes retrieved if triggered \\'\\'today vs tomorrow.\\'\\'A key advantage of this approach is that it can explain the basis for the recommendations.In addition, our approach provides accurate predictions of next-day E2 levels and MII oocyte outcomes that may be helpful to the physician and can be used for patient counseling.We demonstrate the performance of the model using real-world simulations in which the decisions of continuing stimulation or waiting are evaluated on a day-by-day basis.Our hypothesis for this study was that the use of an interpretable machine learning algorithm for optimizing the day of trigger may result in improved outcomes while keeping E2 levels within a safe range. This study was conducted after the research protocol was approved by the WCG Institutional Review Board (Study no.1308073).Patient information was deidentified before analysis. This was a retrospective study using data collected from three different IVF clinics in the United States.Historical, deidentified electronic medical record (EMR) data were collected for IVF retrieval cycles started between 2014 and 2020.Records were filtered for autologous, noncanceled cycles.A total of 30,278 cycles were included in this study.An overview of the study design and methodology is shown in Supplemental Figure 1 (available online). Data for training and testing the models were parsed from the EMRs.The parameters investigated included age, body mass index (BMI), number of previous IVF cycles, baseline antral follicle count (AFC), baseline anti-m€ ullerian hormone (AMH) levels, baseline E2 levels, cycle length in days, and day-by-day measurements of follicle sizes and E2 levels from monitoring visits during ovarian stimulation.Follicle measurements were binned into 6 groups on the basis of their diameter: <11 mm, 11-13 mm, 14-15 mm, 16-17 mm, 18-19 mm, and >19 mm.The primary outcome was the number of MII oocytes retrieved, and cycles were excluded if they were missing this outcome.Additional outcomes included 2PNs and usable blastocysts (defined as the total number of transferred and frozen blastocysts).Furthermore, cycles with apparent data entry errors were excluded, such as cycles in which the number of MII oocytes exceeded the number of oocytes retrieved.Data were split by patient ID into train (70%), validation (10%), and test (20%) data sets stratified by three sites.Performance in this article is reported on the test data set.Cycles from all stimulation protocols were included in the study.After data preparation, there were 2,555 cycles from site 1, 13,051 cycles from site 2, and 14,672 cycles from site 3. Models were developed to enable the prediction of MII outcomes if a patient is triggered in the current day (today) compared with the next day (tomorrow), with the goal of having model interpretability.To predict the number of MII oocytes retrieved if triggered today or tomorrow, linear regression models were developed using follicle counts and E2 levels measured on the day of trigger and one day before the day of trigger, respectively.Finally, an E2 forecasting model was developed to predict next-day E2 levels using follicle counts and E2 levels measured 1 day earlier.Together, the combination of these models allowed a comparison of MII outcomes if triggered today vs. tomorrow. Linear regression model development.Linear regression models were developed to predict the outcome of MII oocytes and next-day E2 levels using the candidate parameters previously mentioned.Approximately 83% of patient cycles had follicle and E2 measurements on the day of trigger, which were used to develop the same-day (trigger today) MII oocyte prediction model.Approximately 57% of patient cycles had follicle and E2 measurements on the day before trigger, which were used to develop the next-day (trigger tomorrow) MII oocyte prediction and E2 prediction models.All input parameters were standardized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of the training data set.Recursive feature elimination was used to identify the most significant parameters.Final models using only the most significant features were trained on the training data set and tuned on the validation data set, and performance was evaluated on the test data set by calculating the mean absolute error (MAE) and R 2 between the predicted number of MII oocytes and actual number of MII oocytes. Follicle imputation.To increase the reliability of follicle measurements, a simple follicle imputation algorithm was implemented for each patient record.This algorithm employed a growth constraint on the binned follicle measurements starting on the second monitoring visit to ensure that each observed follicle either grew or remained the same size as the cycle continued. Trigger-day recommendation algorithm.A trigger-day recommendation algorithm was developed using the set of linear regression models.For each patient in the test data set, the algorithm evaluated each of the monitoring visits day-by-day, starting from day 7, to simulate real-world scenarios.For each day of stimulation, the number of MII oocytes were predicted if triggered today and if triggered tomorrow, and the E2 level tomorrow was predicted (Supplemental Fig. 2 ).If the predicted number of MII oocytes today vs tomorrow showed an increasing trend, the algorithm recommended to continue stimulation.If the predicted number of MII oocytes today vs. tomorrow showed a decreasing trend, the algorithm recommended to trigger.In addition, if the end of the stimulation cycle was reached and the model had not yet recommended trigger, the model would recommend continuing another day only if the MII trend continued to increase and the predicted number of MII oocytes was <15 and the predicted E2 was <5,000 pg/mL. Expected benefit from using the trigger model.Data from patients in the test set were used to calculate the expected benefit of using the trigger-day recommendation model.By comparing the model recommendations with the actual trigger days, patients were classified as having an early, on-time, or late trigger.To adjust for factors related to being triggered early or late, propensity score matching was used to match patients in the early/late group with patients in the on-time group.Propensity scores were calculated by training a logistic regression model to predict whether a patient would be triggered early/late or on-time using age, BMI, baseline AMH level, and baseline AFC, on all patients in the test set.Each patient\\'s propensity score was taken as the predicted probability output of the logistic regression model.Each patient in the early/late group was matched 1:1 with the patient in the on-time group with the closest propensity score.Patients with early or late triggers were then compared with matched patients with on-time triggers in terms of average MII oocytes, 2PNs, and usable blastocysts to calculate the expected benefit of using the model.A small subset of cycles, which included MII outcomes but did not measure usable blastocysts (e.g., cleavage-stage embryo transfers or oocyte freezing cycles), were included for training and testing the MII prediction models, but they were excluded from the expected benefit analysis. Supplemental Table 1 summarizes the patient demographics and cycle information for the cycles included in the study.The average day of trigger in our data set was 11.8AE 1.9, and the average number of monitoring visits per cycle was 4.5AE 1.4.The linear regression model for predicting MII outcomes on the day of trigger had a MAE of 2.87 oocytes and an R 2 of 0.64 on the test data set, and the model for predicting the next-day MII outcomes had an MAE of 3.02 oocytes and an R 2 of 0.62 on the test data set.The next-day E2 levels were predicted with a MAE of 274 pg/mL and R 2 of 0.88.Implementation of the follicle imputation algorithm improved the MAE by 0.09 oocytes and R 2 by 0.02.We also tried using generalized linear models with Poisson or negative binomial distributions, because they can be appropriate for data in which the response variable contains positive integers.However, in practice, we found that regular linear regression performed the best (Supplemental Table 2 ). The most important feature for predicting the outcome of MII oocytes on the day of trigger was follicles of size 14-15 mm, followed by follicles of size 16-17 mm (Fig. 1 ).The least important feature was large follicles of size >19 mm.For predicting the outcome of the next-day MII oocytes, follicles of size 11-13 mm were of greatest importance, whereas follicles of size >19 mm remained the least important.Precycle parameters such as age, BMI, AMH level, and AFC were not significant in a multivariate model that included follicle counts and E2 levels.To ensure data quality and to evaluate follicle measurement noise, a separate model was developed to predict MII oocytes outcomes using follicle counts from the left and right ovaries separately.This model showed that the left and right follicle counts had similar coefficients for all bins, with the exception of the smallest bin (%10 mm), and followed the same feature importance trends as the original model that adds together the follicles from both ovaries (Fig. 2 ).Unstandardized model coefficients are shown in Supplemental Table 3 , representing how a unit change in each predictor variable would change the predicted MII outcome. In the test data set, possible early and late triggers were idenin 48.7% and 13.8% of cycles, respectively, by comparing the actual day of trigger with what the model would have recommended (Fig. 3 ).Patient parameters (age, BMI, baseline AMH level, and baseline AFC) were different across early, on-time, and late trigger groups, indicating that propensity matching was appropriate.Across all test data, patients with early triggers had on average 5.3 fewer MII oocytes, 4.0 fewer 2PNs, and 2.0 fewer usable blastocysts compared with patients with on-time triggers.Patients with late triggers had on average 7.9 fewer MII oocytes, 6.0 fewer 2PNs, and 2.9 fewer usable blastocysts compared with patients with on-time triggers.After propensity score matching, patients with early triggers had on average 2.3 fewer MII oocytes, 1.8 fewer 2PNs, and 1.0 fewer usable blastocysts, and patients with late triggers had on average 2.7 fewer MII oocytes, 2.0 fewer 2PNs, and 0.7 fewer usable blastocysts compared with matched patients with on-time triggers (Table 1 ).After propensity matching, the patient parameters between groups were not statistically different. A subanalysis was performed for patients who did not reach the threshold of 15 predicted MII oocytes (85% of all cycles).In this group, possible early and late triggers were identified in 59.3% and 16.8% of cycles, respectively.Patients with early triggers had on average 1.0 fewer MII oocytes, 0.6 fewer 2PNs, and 0.4 fewer usable blastocysts, and patients with late triggers had on average 3.6 fewer MII oocytes, 2.7 fewer 2PNs, and 1.3 fewer usable blastocysts compared with patients with on-time triggers. This study is one of the first to develop an interpretable machine learning model for optimizing the day of trigger during ovarian stimulation.Our results show that over half of all cycles had possible early or late triggers on the basis of retrospective analysis.After propensity score matching, patients with early triggers had on average 2.3 fewer MII oocytes, 1.8 fewer 2PNs, and 1.0 fewer usable blastocysts, and patients FIGURE 2 Summary of linear regression model standardized coefficients when separating follicle bins by left and right ovaries.Coefficients showed consistency between ovaries, and overall feature importance was similar to that of the original model, which adds together follicles from both ovaries. with late triggers had on average 2.7 fewer MII oocytes, 2.0 fewer 2PNs, and 0.7 fewer usable blastocysts compared with matched patients with on-time triggers.These results indicate that significant improvements in outcomes could potentially be achieved for over half of all ovarian stimulation cycles by following the recommendations of our model. This study places an emphasis on using interpretable machine learning techniques.Previous studies on optimizing the day of trigger have used a machine learning model with bagged decision trees, consisting of an ensemble of 30 different models (8) .Such an approach has the advantage of capturing more complex and nonlinear relationships between the input parameters.This important work was one of the first to demonstrate that it is possible to use machine learning for trigger optimization.However, black-box models are inherently difficult to interpret and could have unseen problems such as overfitting or spurious correlations.The results reported in an earlier study (8) showed that outcomes could be improved by 1.43 more 2PNs and 0.57 more usable blastocysts per cycle on average using their model.Our results also show comparable improvements in 2PNs and usable blastocysts and are important for two reasons.First, our work confirms the previously reported results but across multiple different clinics and with a much larger sample size.Second, our work shows that a linear, interpretable model may provide performances similar to those of more complicated black-box models.This is not surprising, given that the inputs to these models consist of a small number of parameters.Indeed, when applying more complicated models such as random forest and XGBoost regressors to our data set to predict the outcome of MII oocytes, we found that these more complex models did not significantly improve the accuracy of prediction, despite efforts to optimize hyperparameters (Supplemental Table 2 ).For nonlinear models, relative feature importance can be retrospectively inferred using various post hoc analyses; however, these analyses do not directly explain how features are used to generate predicted outputs, and therefore the models remain black-box.As the field of assisted reproduction investigates the use of machine learning technologies, model interpretability will likely be an important part of achieving clinical trust and adoption (9) . The standardized model coefficients indicate that follicles of 14-15 mm and 16-17 mm in diameter were most important for predicting the outcome of MII oocytes if triggered today, whereas follicles of %10 mm and >19 mm were the least important (Fig. 1 ).This result is in line with the accepted notion that very small follicles are less likely to yield a mature oocyte (5, 6) and supports the idea that larger follicles may degenerate or produce postmature oocytes (10) .Our model provides greater fidelity than the standard practice of monitoring lead follicle size and could provide physicians with more detailed temporal information to make an informed trigger decision.For example, if a decrease in the predicted number of MII oocytes were to be observed on consecutive days, the model coefficients would suggest that the lead follicles are growing too big, which can be verified by the physician.Conversely, an increase in the predicted number of MII oocytes could suggest that the smaller follicles are continuing to grow into the optimal size range, which also can be confirmed. Unstandardized model coefficients allow for direct interpretability on how one additional follicle of any given size changes the predicted MII outcome.For example, as shown in Supplemental Table 3 , a single follicle of size 11-13 mm contributes 0.52 oocytes for the trigger today model and 0.71 oocytes for the trigger tomorrow model.For a patient with 10 follicles of size 11-13 mm, this represents an additional 1.9 MII oocytes that could be obtained from this follicle group by waiting one additional day before trigger.Of course, this must be balanced against the potential loss of MII oocytes from other follicles that are growing too large.As shown in Supplemental Table 3 , a single follicle of size 16-17 mm contributes 0.69 oocytes for the trigger today model and 0.57 oocytes for the trigger tomorrow model.For a patient with 10 follicles of size 16-17 mm, this represents 1.2 fewer MII oocytes that would be obtained from this follicle group by waiting another day.The full linear regression model weighs the relative contributions of each follicle group and provides an objective assessment of the potential benefit or harm of waiting another day before the trigger.In developing our model, we explored different outcomes such as oocytes retrieved, MII oocytes, 2PNs, and usable blastocysts.Although all of these outcomes are important, the goal of a successful IVF cycle is of course a healthy live birth.It was not possible with our data to calculate accurate cumulative live birth rates, but our estimates showed that the oocytes retrieved, MII oocytes, and 2PNs all had a positive correlation with live birth outcomes, agreeing with previous studies (11) .However, there may be a plateau for higher responders, which has been suggested in other studies (12, 13) .We decided to use MII oocytes as our primary outcome, because the number of mature oocytes is a direct outcome of ovarian stimulation, whereas other outcomes such as 2PNs and blastocysts depend on the quality of sperm and laboratory procedures.We note that most of our data came from intracytoplasmic sperm injection cycles in which MII oocytes can be most accurately counted.However, we also included conventional IVF cycles if the EMR had an entry for MII oocytes, as we found that excluding conventional IVF cycles had no meaningful impact on our model performance, improving model accuracy by less than 1%. In evaluating our model performance, the recommendation would default to trigger if the end of the cycle had been reached and the predicted number of MII oocytes had surpassed R15 oocytes or the predicted E2 level had surpassed R5,000 pg/mL.These cutoffs would of course vary between physicians and clinics, but the purpose of using them was to demonstrate that we can optimize outcomes within a reasonable range, and not simply push the high responders to yield more oocytes, at the cost of increased hyperstimulation risk.Furthermore, among only patients who did not exceed the 15 MII oocyte cutoff, we showed improved outcomes for on-time patients compared with late and early patients, demonstrating that optimizing the trigger timing could improve outcomes among patients who are not high responders. Our model to predict the outcome of MII oocytes relies on the accurate measurement of follicle sizes.However, it is known that follicle measurements can be subject to intraand interobserver variability (14) (15) (16) .In addition, as the number of follicles increases, our data suggest that small follicles may not always be counted.The reasons for this are not clear, but it could be because more importance is placed on the larger follicles that are expected to yield a mature oocyte or that follicles that are unlikely to grow enough are ignored closer to the time of trigger.Other possibilities include vanishing follicles, which is a rarely observed phenomenon in women with advancing age (17) .In general, however, we expect that follicles should not disappear during the ovarian stimulation process.For this reason, we implemented a follicle imputation algorithm to make sure that the total follicle count always stayed the same or increased.This imputation helped achieve a small improvement in the performance of our model.Linear regression models trained on follicles separated by ovary show that the right and left ovary bins had very similar coefficients for follicle bin sizes, with the exception of the smallest bin (%10 mm) that had a larger coefficient for the left ovary than that for the right ovary.This observation is likely a result of the aforementioned inconsistencies in small follicle measurements across sites.Despite this, the small follicle bin for our original model, which adds together the follicles from both ovaries, had a strong predictive value in our models and was therefore kept as an input feature.We believe that successful clinical use of our model in the future will depend on accurate follicle counting at each monitoring visit during ovarian stimulation. This study is not without limitations; the primary limitation is its retrospective nature.We did not differentiate between different trigger medications or types of protocols, which should be explored further in future work.Some cycles in our data set had incomplete or missing data.For example, in some cycles, there were no ultrasound measurements taken on the day of trigger.These cycles were therefore excluded from our analysis, which could have introduced a sampling bias.It is possible that our results and feature importance could be biased by the trigger practice of the clinics, for example, if patients are always triggered when two or more follicles reach 18 mm in size.However, the possibility for bias should be reduced by the fact that our training data comes from three separate clinics with varying practices on when to trigger patients.In addition, our data include patients pushed further than a clinic\\'s general guidelines as well as those triggered earlier on the basis of E2 levels.Additionally, although we implemented an E2 level threshold as a surrogate marker for the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, we did not have data on which patients had actually been hyperstimulated.Similarly, our models were not able to incorporate risks of other adverse clinical events, such as premature ovulation, given that our data set included only completed cycles.Expanding our data set in future work will allow for the ability to train models to recognize at risk for these complications.Finally, our model did not take into account a patient\\'s previous stimulation results, as our analysis did not show that outcomes from a patient\\'s first stimulation could further improve predictions of outcomes in their second stimulation.However, this should also be further investigated in future work. This study is one of the first to develop an interpretable machine learning model for optimizing the day of trigger during ovarian stimulation.Our results indicate that an interpretable machine learning model can potentially improve outcomes in a considerable number of patients.Future work will focus on continuing to increase the size and diversity of our training data set and performing prospective validation studies to show improved patient outcomes with the use of our model.

Fertility and Sterility®\\n\\n==================================================\\n\\nFile: Andrewartha_et_al-2022-Cochrane_Database_of_Systematic_Reviews.grobid.tei.json\\nTitle: Perioperative pharmacological interventions for fetal immobilisation during fetal surgery and invasive procedures\\nAuthors: Kate [] Andrewartha, Rosalie [\\'M\\'] Grivell\\nAbstract: a We downgraded (2\\nBody Text: Developments in ultrasound assessment of pregnancy has resulted in the increasing diagnosis of antenatal fetal issues.Many structural fetal conditions as well as complications associated with multiple pregnancies have the potential for in-utero treatment to improve both pregnancy and neonatal outcomes.Procedures such as laser ablation for twin-twin syndrome or cord occlusion for selective fetal termination require fetal immobilisation.Immobilisation of the fetus can occur through administration of medication to the mother or directly to the fetus.This improves procedural success and reduces the ongoing risk to the pregnancy.Evidence regarding the best medication and mode of delivery helps to ensure the optimal decision is made for both the mother and the fetus. To assess the e ects of perioperative pharmacological interventions for fetal immobilisation during fetal surgery and invasive procedures on fetal, neonatal, and maternal outcomes. We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth\\'s Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (10 May 2021), and reference lists of retrieved studies. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs (including published abstracts) which compared di erent classes of medication administered to the mother or fetus to allow in-utero procedures to be performed.We also included cluster-randomised trials but excluded cross-over trials. We used the standard Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth methods for data collection and analysis.Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data, and checked them for accuracy. One study with three trial reports met the inclusion criteria.This involved 54 women with a multiple pregnancy.The study was conducted in a tertiary European hospital maternal-fetal medicine unit and compared remifentanil to diazepam for fetal immobilisation and maternal sedation during fetoscopic surgery. Low-certainty evidence suggested that remifentanil may reduce fetal movement more than diazepam for two outcomes of fetal movement, one of fetal immobilisation at 40 minutes using a visual analogue score (VAS) (where 0 = immobile and 100 = baseline mobility), and one of gross body and limb movements (score was absolute number of movements), both assessed by a sonographer evaluating a taped ultrasound sequence (mean di erence (MD) -65.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) -69.38 to -60.62 and MD -10.00, 95% 1 study, 50 women) . Surgeons may also report being more satisfied with the procedure when using remifentanil rather than diazepam (risk ratio (RR) 2.88, 95% CI 1.60 to 5.15; 1 study, 50 women; low-certainty evidence).However, maternal respiratory rate may decrease more during the surgical procedure with remifentanil compared with diazepam (MD -6.00, 95% CI -8.29 to -3.71; 1 study, 50 women; low-certainty evidence).Maternal sedation may also be worse with remifentanil compared with diazepam (RR 0.09, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.65; 1 study, 50 women; low-certainty evidence) measured using an observer assessment of alertness/sedation (where a score of < 4 equates to profound sedation and > 4 equates to insu icient sedation).Perinatal mortality and time taken to perform the procedure were not reported in the trial. We prespecified 20 outcomes and planned to use GRADE for 6 of them, all other outcomes were not able to be reported against for the purpose of meta-analysis due to data not being provided or unable to be interpreted. We assessed the included study at low risk of selection bias (appropriate random sequence generation and allocation concealment), performance bias (blinding of participants and personnel), detection bias (outcome assessors were blinded), attrition bias (incomplete outcome data minimal), and reporting bias. Our GRADE assessment for certainty of the evidence indicates that there is low certainty of the evidence. We were only able to include one study with a small number of women, from a single centre, a European tertiary hospital.This study was published in 2005 with an abstract of this trial published in 2004.This study evaluated two intravenous medications administered to the mother -remifentanil and diazepam.This study reported our prespecified primary outcome but only evaluated several of our secondary outcomes, which limited further assessment.Low-certainty evidence suggested that remifentanil may be better at reducing fetal movements and surgeons were more satisfied with the procedure.However, maternal sedation and depression of breathing may be worse with remifentanil. Further high-quality RCTs assessing both fetal and maternal medications are required to evaluate their e icacy for fetal immobilisation as well as safety for both mother and fetus. We looked for evidence from randomised controlled trials on the e ectiveness of anaesthetic and pain relief medication for preventing fetal movements (fetal immobilisation) to allow surgical and other invasive procedures to be performed safely on the unborn fetus whilst still in the mother\\'s uterus. Use of ultrasound during pregnancy has made great advances resulting in increased diagnosis of problems with the development of unborn babies.Many structural fetal problems as well as complications associated with multiple pregnancies can be treated while babies are still in the mother\\'s uterus.Many problems generally require treatment before birth, for example a blockage in the airways.We set out to determine which medications are e ective at providing fetal immobilisation for in-utero procedures to be performed, as well as looking at the e ect on the mother in terms of sedation and pain relief.For these procedures to be performed safely, fetal movements may need to be reduced.This can be done by giving medication either to the mother (usually by injection into a vein) or directly to the fetus (by injecting into fetal muscle). Treatment of structural issues such as lung or heart problems can greatly improve pregnancy and newborn outcomes.Similarly, with multiple pregnancy complications such as twin-twin transfusion syndrome, where there is unequal sharing of the one placenta between the twins.Providing the best surgical conditions with reduced fetal movements means that the procedure can be performed safely and reduces complications such as preterm birth.It is also important to provide a safe environment for the mother without side e ects such as oversedation or lack of pain relief during the procedure. What evidence did we find? We searched for evidence from randomised controlled trials to May 2021 and identified one eligible trial involving 54 pregnant women.All were women with a multiple pregnancy in their second trimester attending a European hospital for specialist care.The women received intravenous injection of either remifentanil or diazepam to immobilise the fetus and to sedate the mother during fetoscopic surgery.This is where a small instrument (laparoscope) is inserted through the mother\\'s abdominal wall and into the uterus to see the fetus and placenta.The trial gave low-certainty evidence.The main outcome looked at was how much the baby moved via assessment of body and limb movements.Maternal outcomes were the amount of sedation and depression of breathing.The time for surgery and surgical satisfaction with the procedural conditions were also measured.Low-certainty evidence suggested that remifentanil may be better at reducing fetal movements when compared to diazepam and surgeons were more satisfied with the procedure when using remifentanil.However, the amount of maternal sedation and depression of breathing were worse with remifentanil. Low-certainty evidence from one small trial means that we cannot be confident in the results.The information available on maternal, fetal, and newborn outcomes was limited.More high-quality trials are needed to increase our certainty about the longer term fetal and newborn impact of the medication used for fetal immobilisation for in-utero procedures, as well as other medications which may be suitable for use.Moderate certainty: we are moderately confident in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different.Low certainty: our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.Very low certainty: we have very little confidence in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews B A C K G R O U N D The increasing use of advanced ultrasound technologies, in combination with increased multiple pregnancy rates globally and the development of novel procedures to address fetal problems in utero has resulted in more invasive fetal procedures and surgeries being performed during pregnancy.Fetal conditions that may be suitable for in-utero interventions include fetal tumours, lung and airway lesions, cardiac abnormalities, urinary tract abnormalities, and complications associated with monochorionic twin pregnancies.Increasing diagnosis of severe and lifethreatening fetal conditions has also resulted in more frequent termination of pregnancy. Congenital abnormalities of the urinary tract are relatively common (1/250 to 1000 pregnancies) (Ruano 2011) .Bilateral ureteric or bladder outflow obstruction carries a particularly poor prognosis.Without intervention, LUTO has a perinatal mortality rate of 90% and more than 50% of survivors require renal dialysis or transplantation (Ruano 2011) .Therapeutic interventions include vesicocentesis (draining the fetal bladder with a needle), vesicoamniotic shunting (placing a tube from the bladder into the amniotic cavity) (Kilby 2013) , and fetal cystoscopy (looking at the fetal bladder with a small camera), which can both diagnose and treat posterior urethral valves.Fetal cystoscopy requires maternal epidural or local anaesthesia combined with direct fetal administration of anaesthetic agents (Ruano 2011) .Despite inutero treatment of these conditions, there is ongoing concern regarding the long-term renal function for children with the above conditions (Cheung 2019). Fetal lung lesions, most commonly congenital cystic adenomatous malformations, bronchopulmonary sequestration (CPAM) or \\'hybrid\\' lesions, occur in 1/10,000 to 35,000 pregnancies (Witlox 2011) .CPAM account for 30% to 40% of all diagnosed congenital lung malformations (Zobel 2019) .While many of these may regress over the course of pregnancy, they may be associated with severe fetal compromise leading to the need for in-utero procedures.These procedures include thoracocentesis (ultrasound-guided needle drainage), thoraco-amniotic shunting (placing a tube from the cyst cavity inside the chest to the amniotic cavity), ultrasoundguided laser coagulation of the arteries that supply the lesion, and open surgical resection of severe lesions (Witlox 2011) .Advances in fetal treatment options have improved survival rates to around 95% (Zobel 2019) .Fetoscopic tracheal occlusion procedures (plugging of the fetal trachea) have been advocated to induce growth and expansion of the hypoplastic (underdeveloped) lung (Van de Velde 2012). Congenital diaphragmatic hernias occur in approximately 1:4000 pregnancies with le -sided defects more common than right (Dolk 2010) .These defects o en result in abdominal contents herniating into the thoracic cavity causing fetal lung hypoplasia and resultant neonatal respiratory failure, pulmonary hypertension with a significant risk of mortality.In-utero fetoscopic endoluminal tracheal occlusion (FETO) performed early in the third trimester has shown to significantly improve survival and neonatal outcomes (Deprest 2021) . Fetal heart lesions that may be suitable for intracardiac intervention during pregnancy include stenotic valvular lesions (where there is a critical narrowing of the heart valve), in addition to some other more complicated structural anomalies.In-utero interventions aim to facilitate both the growth and functioning of the heart (Artz 2011) .However, due to the complexity of fetal cardiac abnormalities only approximately 5% of those with major congenital heart disease (CHD) are likely to benefit from in-utero treatment (Gardiner 2019). A range of spinal lesions can be detected by perinatal ultrasound.Myelomeningocele, the most severe form of spina bifida, may be associated with significant complications including hindbrain herniation, hydrocephalus, as well as both sensory, motor, and bowel/urinary dysfunction (Kabagambe 2018) .In-utero treatment with closure of the spinal defect reduces the duration of time the spinal cord is exposed to amniotic fluid.This is superior to neonatal treatment with improved outcomes, including mental development and motor function, for those who receive in-utero correction (Adzick 2011) . Sampling of fetal blood via cordocentesis, also known as percutaneous umbilical blood sampling, allows increased diagnostic accuracy for many fetal conditions including fetal anaemia, hydrops, neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia, and fetal genetic disorders.The ability to access fetal vasculature in utero may enable timely treatment during pregnancy, most commonly fetal red blood cell or platelet transfusions (Fox 2012) . Monochorionic twin pregnancies share the same placental mass and due to vascular connections there may be discordance in blood supply to each twin, which can result in twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS).TTTS occurs in up to 15% of monochorionic twin pregnancies, and untreated has a mortality rate of 90% (Chalouhi 2011) .Treatment may involve selective laser coagulation of placental vessels, which involves performing an in-utero procedure (Roberts 2008) . All types of multiple pregnancy are at risk for \\'selective\\' structural and chromosomal anomalies.As mentioned, monochorionic twin pairs are at particular risk for TTTS and also selective growth restriction.In some of these situations one option for management might be to selectively \\'reduce\\' the fetus with the poor or poorest prognosis in order to prolong pregnancy or to improve outcomes for the remaining fetus/es.Selective reduction procedures all require a fetal intervention and thus fetal immobilisation is an important part of such a procedure.In some settings, for example, late termination of pregnancy with a singleton fetus, feticide prior to induction of labour may be o ered/performed. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Fetal interventions performed during pregnancy may involve open fetal surgery with maternal laparotomy, obstetric endoscopy (fetoscopy), and ultrasound-guided needling techniques.During these procedures described above, movement of the fetus increases the technical di iculty of the procedure and may contribute to trauma, as well as increasing the required operating time.Whilst there is much debate surrounding the perception of pain in the fetus, pain transmission can be demonstrated in controlled settings from approximately 16 weeks\\' gestation, and these pathways are completely developed from 26 weeks.With the recognition of a fetal stress response in response to procedures and in particular to noxious stimuli, e ective fetal anaesthesia and analgesia may modify the fetal response, improve fetal outcome and possibly limit preterm labour (Anand 2001; Brusseau 2013) . Various methods and routes of administration have been utilised to aid in fetal immobilisation and provide both anaesthesia and analgesia.These include transplacental routes (maternal general anaesthesia and other maternal medications), and combined spinal epidural and local anaesthesia with direct fetal administration of analgesic/anaesthetic medications (intravenous (IV), intramuscular (IM), or intra-amniotic) (Fink 2011 ). To date, although the literature describes various routes of administration, their relative advantages and disadvantages and commonly used doses of medication, little is known about shortand long-term safety for the fetus a er such medications are given (Brusseau 2013) .Even simple pharmacokinetic profiles are poorly described for most agents, with the volatile agents best described, for example, isoflurane levels in the fetus reach 70% of maternal levels a er 60 minutes of administration (Brusseau 2013) . At this time in clinical practice, the choice of anaesthetic and analgesic agents, their dose, and the mode of administration are ultimately determined by the procedure performed, clinical experience, and the medical condition of the fetus. Open fetal surgery is used for repair of severe fetal lung lesions, and severe spine and spinal cord lesions (such as myelomeningocoele (Adzick 2011 ) and sacral teratomas) (Schwarz 2003) .It requires maternal general anaesthesia (with or without epidural anaesthesia), and fetal anaesthesia, which can be achieved by placental transfer of anaesthetic agents administered to the mother, or additional administration of fetal opioids and muscle relaxants (Van de Velde 2012).There appears to be little consensus on the most appropriate agents for maternal general anaesthesia.Epidural anaesthesia and IV induction agents (thiopental, propofol, etomidate, and ketamine), as well as volatile anaesthetics (inhaled gases, e.g.halothane and isoflurane) have all been used in pregnancy.Newer volatile agents (desflurane, seroflurane) have not yet been studied, but it has been hypothesised that they will undergo rapid placental transfer to the fetus (Tran 2010) .Other agents that are used for their ability to induce both maternal and fetal anaesthesia include thiopental, propofol, diazepam, morphine, remifentanil, and midazolam (Tran 2010) . Most fetoscopic surgery is well tolerated under maternal local anaesthesia, although maternal regional anaesthesia (spinal, epidural, or combined spinal epidural) is o en used for complex procedures.Combined spinal and epidural anaesthesia provide neither fetal immobilisation or anaesthesia, so additional agents are required (IV maternal agents, or fetal IM/IV opioids and muscle relaxants) (Van de Velde 2012).Agents that have been studied in this setting include remifentanil (a short-acting potent opioid), diazepam, or propofol administered to the woman.Alternative strategies to immobilise the fetus involve the direct administration of anaesthetic agents to the fetus, including fentanyl and pancuronium (either IM or IV into the umbilical vein) (Ruano 2011) .For situations that require complete fetal immobilisation, direct fetal administration of fentanyl, vecuronium, and atropine is o en required. To ensure an in-utero procedure is successful a medication must be chosen that provides a combination of three pharmacological aspects -analgesia, anaesthesia, and paralysis.The type and level of complexity of the procedure being performed and the degree of immobilisation required contributes to which medication may be chosen.For example, complete immobilisation is required as well as providing analgesia/anaesthesia for the fetus during fetal blood sampling.However, some movement may in fact be advantageous to gain access to the placental vessels when performing laser procedures for the treatment of twin-twin syndrome. Successful fetal anaesthesia and analgesia reduce fetal movements, which in turn may result in a reduction in fetal trauma during surgery, reduced surgical technical di iculty with increased surgical success, and shorter operating times.Furthermore, fetal anaesthesia and analgesia may reduce the fetal stress response to painful stimuli, and may prevent long-term adverse neurodevelopmental and behavioural responses to pain (Fink 2011) . It is also important to consider how a medication may a ect the woman with evaluation of maternal sedation versus no sedation as well as maternal analgesia/anaesthesia versus none.A safe maternal environment is required to ensure there is no subsequent fetal harm. The increasing frequency of fetal surgery and other interventions during pregnancy requires the assessment of perioperative pharmacological interventions during fetal surgery and invasive procedures. To assess the e ects of perioperative pharmacological interventions for fetal immobilisation during fetal surgery and invasive procedures on fetal, neonatal, and maternal outcomes. Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials that compared the following interventions: maternal sedation versus no sedation, maternal analgesia/anaesthesia versus nothing, fetal paralysis versus nothing, combinations versus nothing, one intervention versus another. Trials using a cross-over design or cluster-randomised trials were not included.We included studies presented as abstracts if enough information was presented for us to make an assessment.

We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth\\'s Trials Register by contacting their Information Specialist (10 May 2021). The Register is a database containing over 25,000 reports of controlled trials in the field of pregnancy and childbirth.It represents over 30 years of searching.For full current search methods used to populate Pregnancy and Childbirth\\'s Trials Register including the detailed search strategies for CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL; the list of handsearched journals and conference proceedings, and the list of journals reviewed via the current awareness service, please follow this link. Briefly, Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth\\'s Trials Register is maintained by their Information Specialist and contains trials identified from: 1. monthly searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); 2. weekly searches of MEDLINE (Ovid); 3. weekly searches of Embase (Ovid); 4. monthly searches of CINAHL (EBSCO); 5. handsearches of 30 journals and the proceedings of major conferences; 6. weekly current awareness alerts for a further 44 journals plus monthly BioMed Central email alerts. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Search results are screened by two people and the full text of all relevant trial reports identified through the searching activities described above is reviewed.Based on the intervention described, each trial report is assigned a number that corresponds to a specific Pregnancy and Childbirth review topic (or topics), and is then added to the Register.The Information Specialist searches the Register for each review using this topic number rather than keywords.This results in a more specific search set that has been fully accounted for in the relevant review sections (Included studies; Excluded studies; Studies awaiting classification; Ongoing studies). In addition, we searched ClinicalTrials.govand the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) for unpublished, planned, and ongoing trial reports (10 May 2021) using the search methods detailed in Appendix 1. We searched reference lists of retrieved studies. We have not applied any language restrictions. The following methods section is based on a standard template used by Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth. Two review authors have independently assessed for inclusion all the potential studies we identified as a result of the search strategy.We resolved any disagreement through discussion or, if required, we consulted a third person. We created a study flow diagram to map out the number of records identified, included, excluded, or awaiting classification. All studies meeting our inclusion criteria have been evaluated by two review authors against predefined criteria to select studies that, based on available information, are deemed to be su iciently trustworthy to be included in the analysis.The criteria areas follow. • Are there any retraction notices or expressions of concern listed on the Retraction Watch Database relating to this study? • Was the study prospectively registered (for those studies published a er 2010)?If not, have the authors provided a plausible reason?• When requested, did the trial authors provide/share the protocol or ethics approval letter or both?• Did the trial authors engage in communication with Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth within the agreed timelines?• Did the trial authors provide individual participant data (IPD) upon request?If not, was there a plausible reason? • Is the study free from characteristics of the study participants that appear too similar (e.g.distribution of the mean (standard deviation (SD)) excessively narrow or excessively wide, as noted by Carlisle 2017)? • Is the study free from characteristics that could be implausible (e.g.large numbers of women with a rare condition recruited from a single centre within 12 months)?• In cases with (close to) zero losses to follow-up, is there a plausible explanation? • Is the study free from results that could be implausible (e.g.massive risk reduction for main outcomes with small sample size)?• Do the numbers randomised to each group suggest that adequate randomisation methods were used (e.g. is the study free from issues such as unexpectedly even numbers of women \\'randomised\\', including a mismatch between the numbers and the methods, equal number of randomised participants when \\'no blocking was used\\', or if the authors say they used \\'blocks of 4\\' but the final numbers di er by 6)? • Studies assessed as being potentially \\'high risk\\' have not been included in the review.Where a study was classified as \\'high risk\\' for one or more of the above criteria, we attempted to contact the study authors to address any possible lack of information/ concerns.If adequate information remained unavailable, the study would remain in \\'awaiting classification\\' and the reasons and communications with the author (or lack of) described in detail. The process is described in Figure 1 . We have designed a form to extract data.For eligible studies, at least two review authors have extracted the data using the agreed form.We have resolved discrepancies through discussion, or, as required, through consultation with a third person.We entered data into Review Manager 5 so ware (RevMan 5) and checked for accuracy (Review Manager 2020).When information regarding any of the above was unclear, we attempted to contact authors of the original reports to provide further details. Two review authors have independently assessed risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011) .We resolved any disagreement by discussion or by involving a third assessor. We described for each included study the method used to generate the allocation sequence in su icient detail to allow an assessment of whether it should produce comparable groups. We assessed the method as: • low risk of bias (any truly random process, e.g.random number table, computer random number generator); • high risk of bias (any non-random process, e.g.odd or even date of birth, hospital or clinic record number); • unclear risk of bias. We described for each included study the method used to conceal allocation to interventions prior to assignment and assessed whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during recruitment, or changed a er assignment. We assessed the methods as: • low risk of bias (e.g.telephone or central randomisation, consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes); • high risk of bias (open random allocation, unsealed or nonopaque envelopes, alternation, date of birth); • unclear risk of bias. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. We described for each included study the methods used, if any, to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received.We considered that studies were at low risk of bias if they were blinded, or if we judged that the lack of blinding would be unlikely to a ect results.We assessed blinding separately for di erent outcomes or classes of outcomes. We assessed the methods as: • low, high, or unclear risk of bias for participants; • low, high, or unclear risk of bias for personnel. We described for each included study the methods used, if any, to blind outcome assessors from knowledge of which intervention a participant received.We assessed blinding separately for di erent outcomes or classes of outcomes. We assessed methods used to blind outcome assessment as: • low, high, or unclear risk of bias. We described for each included study, and for each outcome or class of outcomes, the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis.We stated whether attrition and exclusions were reported and the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes.Where su icient information was reported, or could be supplied by the trial authors, we have re-included missing data in the analyses which we undertook. We assessed methods as: • low risk of bias (e.g.no missing outcome data, missing outcome data balanced across groups); • high risk of bias (e.g.numbers or reasons for missing data imbalanced across groups, \\'as treated\\' analysis done with substantial departure of intervention received from that assigned at randomisation); • unclear risk of bias. We have described for each included study how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found. We have assessed the methods as: • low risk of bias (where it was clear that all of the study\\'s prespecified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported); • high risk of bias (where not all the study\\'s pre-specified outcomes have been reported, one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified, outcomes of interest were reported incompletely and so could not be used, study failed to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported); • unclear risk of bias. We have described for each included study any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias. We have assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias: • low risk of other bias; • high risk of other bias; • unclear whether there was risk of other bias. We have made explicit judgements about whether studies are at high risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011) .With reference to 1. to 6. above, we assessed the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and whether we consider it is likely to impact on the findings.We had planned to explore the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses. For dichotomous data, we presented results as summary risk ratio with 95% confidence intervals. For continuous data, we used the mean di erence if outcomes were measured in the same way between trials.We would use the standardised mean di erence to combine trials that measured the same outcome, but used di erent methods. We did not identify any cluster-randomised trials for inclusion in this review.In future, if we identify any such trials we plan to include them in our analysis along with individually-randomised trials using the methods previously outlined.Where multiple pregnancies were assessed the movements of only one twin were recorded and assessed for the study outcomes. For included studies, levels of attrition were noted.In future updates, if more eligible studies are included, the impact of including studies with high levels of missing data in the overall assessment of treatment e ect will be explored by using sensitivity analysis. For all outcomes, analyses were carried out, as far as possible, on an intention-to-treat basis, i.e. we attempted to include all participants randomised to each group in the analyses.The denominator for each outcome in each trial was the number randomised minus any participants whose outcomes were known to be missing. We planned to assess statistical heterogeneity in each metaanalysis using the Tau , I , and Chi statistics.We have regarded heterogeneity as substantial if I was greater than 30% and either Tau was greater than zero, or there was a low P value (less than 0.10) in the Chi test for heterogeneity. In future updates of this review, if there are 10 or more studies in the meta-analysis, we will investigate reporting biases (such as publication bias) using funnel plots.We will assess funnel plot asymmetry visually.If asymmetry is suggested by a visual assessment, we will perform exploratory analyses to investigate it. We carried out statistical analysis using RevMan 5 (Review Manager 2020) .This review contains one included study, therefore metaanalysis was not possible.We planned to use fixed-e ect metaanalysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment e ect: i.e.where trials were examining the same intervention, and the trials\\' populations and methods were judged su iciently similar.If there was clinical heterogeneity su icient to expect that the underlying treatment e ects di ered between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we would have used random-e ects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary if an average treatment e ect across trials was considered clinically meaningful.The random-e ects summary would be treated as the average of the range of possible treatment e ects, and we have discussed the clinical implications of treatment e ects di ering between trials.If the average treatment e ect was not clinically meaningful we would not combine trials. If we had identified substantial heterogeneity, we planned to investigate it using subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses.We planned to consider whether an overall summary is meaningful, and if it so, use random-e ects analysis to produce it. We planned to carry out the following subgroup analyses but were not able to do so due to the small amount of data available from one trial: • type of procedure performed; • gestational age at the time the procedure was performed; • singleton pregnancy versus multiple pregnancy; • di erent routes of administration -for example, fetal intramuscular injection versus fetal umbilical vein injection. The following outcome would have been used in subgroup analysis: • degree of fetal immobilisation as defined by trial authors. We planned to assess subgroup di erences by interaction tests available within RevMan 5 (Review Manager 2020), reporting the results of subgroup analyses quoting the Chi statistic and P value, and the interaction test I value. Sensitivity analyses were not able to be performed due to the inclusion of a single trial. In future updates, we will perform sensitivity analysis to explore the e ects of trial quality by omitting studies rated as \\'high risk of bias\\' on overall assessment.We will restrict this to the primary outcome. In particular, as quasi-randomised trials are eligible to be included, we plan to perform a sensitivity analysis on the basis of excluding such trials. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach, as outlined in the GRADE handbook.We assessed the certainty of the body of evidence relating to the following outcomes: 1. degree of fetal immobilisation as defined by trial authors; 2. technically successful procedure as defined by trial authors; 3. time taken to perform the planned procedure; 4. perinatal mortality; 5. maternal respiratory depression as defined by trial authors; 6. maternal sedation measured using sedation scores as defined by trial authors. GRADEpro Guideline Development Tool was used to import data from RevMan 5 (Review Manager 2020) in order to create summary of findings tables.A summary of the intervention e ect and a measure of certainty for each of the above outcomes was produced using the GRADE approach. We included one study with two trial reports (Van de Velde 2005) in the review.See Included studies. See Figure 2 . Our search retrieved at total of 174 records, from which 162 were excluded as they were not a trial or were not within the specified scope, see Figure 2 . We assessed 12 trial reports.We included one trial (three reports) and excluded six (eight reports).One trial is ongoing. We applied the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth trustworthiness screening tool (CPC-TST) to the included study Van de Velde 2005.Specifically, upon assessment, there were no concerns regarding research governance (no retractions, prospective registration not required as published before 2005, and no requirement as yet to share protocol).Baseline characteristics and feasibility seemed appropriate, as did the results. We included one study with three trial reports (Van de Velde 2005) in the review.See Included studies. The included study is a double-blind randomised controlled trial. There were 54 women in the included study.Four women were excluded from the study, with the remaining 50 women administered either medication. The included study was conducted in tertiary European hospitals within a high-risk maternal-fetal medicine unit.The included study did not report the trial dates.Funding sources were reported as follows: grants from European Commission (Euro Twin 2 Twin), and also in part by a 2002 Society of Anesthesia and Reanimation of Belgium (SARB) grant for experimental research.Declarations of interest of trial authors were not reported. All women in the included study were in their second trimester with multiple pregnancy.The demographic and clinical characteristics of women in Van de Velde 2005 were similar between groups.Most women included in this study were undergoing laser treatment for twin-twin syndrome.A smaller proportion of women were undergoing intervention for selective cord occlusion. The included study compared maternally administered intravenous remifentanil versus diazepam to achieve fetal immobilisation and maternal sedation.Maternal sedation, haemodynamics, side e ects as well as fetal haemodynamics and immobilisation were evaluated at several time points during the procedure. Remifentanil and diazepam were assessed in regard to both fetal and maternal outcomes.When fetal outcomes were assessed, they were reported for only the mobile twin in cases of twintwin syndrome, and only movements of the normal fetus were recorded in pregnancies where selective feticide/cord occlusion was performed. This study assessed whether remifentanil was superior to diazepam to achieve maternal sedation without respiratory depression along with measurement of maternal pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2), and respiratory rate. Level of fetal immobilisation was assessed via a visual analogue score (VAS) as well as documenting the number of gross body and limb movements. Length of operating time and surgical satisfaction was assessed to determine which medication was superior. A er examining the abstract or full text, we excluded six studies from this review.Four papers were excluded as they either compared the same drug with di erent doses, used medications within the same class, or did not administer any medication to either the mother or the fetus (ACTRN12617000098336; Han 2015; Mouw 1999; van Scheltema 2011).One study was excluded as their inclusion criteria for in-utero complications/procedures was too varied with only small numbers in each category (Fan 1994). One study was excluded as it assessed fetal MRI rather than an in-utero procedure (EUCTR2009-011281-28-BE).For further detail see Excluded studies. Details of the risk of bias assessment for the included study are presented in Characteristics of included studies.Summary description of the assessments is presented in Figure 3 . Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews We judged the included study to have low risk of bias for sequence generation and allocation concealment. We judged our included study Van de Velde 2005 to have low risk of bias for blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias) as well as for blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias).In this study both the woman, obstetrician, and anaesthetist were blinded to the sedative used, with an external/third assessor used to confirm results (the assessor was also blinded). We judged Van de Velde 2005 to have a low risk of attrition bias as there were low rates of incomplete data reported. We judged Van de Velde 2005 to have a low risk of reporting bias. There were no other bias identified for Van de Velde 2005. See: Summary of findings 1 Summary of findings table -Remifentanil compared to diazepam for fetal immobilisation during fetal surgery and invasive procedures See Summary of findings 1 \\'Remifentanil compared to diazepam for fetal immobilisation during fetal surgery and invasive procedures.\\' One trial Van de Velde 2005 with three reports, involving 54 women, was included in this review.This trial compared remifentanil to diazepam (i.e. one intervention versus another).We did not find any other studies to assess any of the other comparisons that had been prespecified when planning the review.Therefore, meta-analysis was not possible. Four women were excluded due to fetuses that were immobile at the beginning of the surgery.The remaining 50 women were randomised to either remifentanil or diazepam. Our planned prespecified comparisons included: maternal sedation versus no sedation, maternal analgesia/anaesthesia versus no analgesia/anaesthesia, fetal paralysis versus no fetal paralysis, combinations versus nothing, and one intervention versus another. The comparison utilised in this one included trial, fits under our prespecified comparison category of one intervention versus another.As diazepam is a sedative (benzodiazepine class) and remifentanil is an analgesic, the comparison is of maternal sedation versus maternal analgesia/anaesthesia.There were therefore no other comparisons that could be included/reported in our review. Our primary outcome was degree of fetal immobilisation as defined by trial authors.The authors of the trial assessed fetal mobility in two ways -by taping fetal movement with ultrasound with subsequent evaluation by sonographer and providing a score, and also counting the gross body and limb movements: \"Fetal mobility was assessed, before, during, and a er surgery by taping 5minute ultrasound sequences of fetal movement every 20 minutes throughout surgery and 10, 20, 30 and 60 minutes a er the end of surgery.These sequences were evaluated by an experienced ultrasonographer.Two types of evaluation were performed: a VAS score for mobility (0 = immobile and 100 = baseline mobility) (which the authors also refer to as \\'fetal immobilisation score\\') and the number of gross body movements and limb movements per 5-minute period (number of fetal movements).\"In this clinical situation a lower score for both parameters would be more favourable, as a less mobile fetus will facilitate a more successful procedure. When aligning the trials outcomes with our prespecified outcome, we chose to use the fetal mobility assessment 40-minute time point, as it was in the middle of the surgical time frame and also data extraction from the paper was feasible as clearly stated in writing (other data were only reported on graphs and could not be extracted). The results suggested that remifentanil may result in less fetal movement (i.e. more fetal immobilisation), when compared with diazepam, as evaluated by the fetal immobilisation score (subjective surgical and objective ultrasound scores) (mean di erence (MD) -65.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) -69.38 to -60.62; 1 study, 50 women; low-certainty evidence; Analysis 1.1). The number of fetal movements may be decreased from 18 ± 3 to 2 ± 1 at 40 minutes of surgery in the remifentanil group, with a much smaller e ect on fetal movement reduction in the diazepam group (MD -10.00, 95% CI -11.62 to -8.38; 1 study, 50 women; low-certainty evidence; Analysis 1.2). Technically successful procedure as defined by trial authors In addition to the evaluation of fetal immobilisation by sonographers reviewing taped periods of the procedure on ultrasound, evaluation of fetal mobility and the procedure was also performed by the surgeon and assessed on a four-point scale: \"At the end of the intervention the surgeon assessed overall fetal immobility and operating conditions using a four-point scale, this subjective score represented an overall subjective impression and is further referred to as the surgical assessment/satisfaction score, 1 = excellent, 2 = good, 3 = moderate and 4 = inadequate immobilisation.\" We have chosen to use the reported outcome of \\'surgical assessment/satisfaction score\\' and align with our prespecified outcome of technically successful procedure. The results suggest that the surgical assessment/satisfaction score may be better in the remifentanil group.It was assessed by the surgeon as being good to excellent (score of 1 or 2) in 92% of women in the remifentanil group, whereas this was 32% in the diazepam group (risk ratio (RR) 2.88, 95% CI 1.60 to 5.15; 1 study, 50 women; low-certainty evidence; Analysis 1.3). The included study did not report this outcome nor any data that we could utilise to report on it. Van de Velde 2005 reported that the time to complete the surgery was significantly longer in the diazepam group, 80 (60 to 90) minutes versus 60 (54 to 71) minutes in the remifentanil group.The included data were only reported with medians/ranges and thus were not suitable for analysis, nor able to be included in further tables, and are reported narratively. For many of our prespecified outcomes, we were either unable to extract or utilise reported data from Van de Velde 2005 or the outcome was not reported at all by the study authors.For clarity, we have listed all our prespecified outcomes below and explained. Cochrane Library Trusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews diazepam.This study reported our prespecified primary outcome but only evaluated several of our secondary outcomes, which limited further assessment. We assessed the included study at low risk of selection bias (appropriate random sequence generation and allocation concealment), performance bias (blinding of participants and personnel), detection bias (outcome assessors were blinded), attrition bias (incomplete outcome data minimal), and reporting bias.We downgraded (2) levels for very serious imprecision due to data only being available from a single small study of 50 women. Our GRADE assessment for certainty of the evidence is that there is low certainty of the evidence (see Summary of findings 1) for all the findings reported. We adhered to the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group search strategies and review processes.Two review authors independently selected potential studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data to minimise potential biases. To our knowledge there are no other studies or reviews addressing the e ectiveness and harms of di erent types and routes of anaesthesia or analgesia for fetal immobilisation for in-utero procedures. Low-certainty evidence suggested that remifentanil may be better at reducing fetal movements and surgeons were more satisfied with the procedure.However, maternal sedation and depression of breathing may be worse with remifentanil.However, these data were from a single small study, and this limits our ability to make definitive conclusions. Due to the low certainty of the evidence for our main outcomes, the e ects of pharmacological interventions for fetal immobilisation in the management of fetal surgery and invasive procedures are uncertain. There is a need for well-designed, multicentre, randomised controlled trials to evaluate the e ectiveness and safety of di erent types and routes of anaesthesia and analgesia to achieve fetal immobilisation for in-utero procedures.We suggest that future studies measure important outcomes listed in this review.

Point of care rapid test for diagnosis of syphilis infection in men and nonpregnant women (Protocol)\\nBody Text: Syphilis is a complex, curable sexually-transmitted infection caused by the Treponema pallidum bacterium that has a variable clinical course (CDC 2014) .It is a cause of acute illness and serious medical and psychological consequences in a small proportion of people infected with the bacteria.Syphillis is also the cause of long-term disability and death of thousands of men, women and infants (Saloojee 2004) .Syphilis is the most common disease during the years of peak sexual activity.In 2012, the estimated global prevalence was 0.5% (0.4% to 0.6%) in women aged 15 to 49 years and 0.48% (0.3% to 0.7%) in men (Newman 2015).These figures correspond to an estimated 6 million new cases of syphilis (4 to 8 million) each year worldwide.Prevalence and incidence estimates varied by region and sex.For syphilis in women, the infection with the most robust available data, the prevalence of infection decreased as average country income increased (Newman 2015). Diagnosis of syphilis is based on a combination of clinical history, symptom presentation, and serologic test results.There are two types of diagnostic tests, treponemal and non-treponemal (PAHO 2015) . The non-treponemal tests such as Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) or rapid plasma reagin (RPR) measure the host\\'s response to non-treponemal antigens such as cardiolipin and lecithin released from the damaged host cells, as well as lipoprotein-like material released from the treponema.These non-treponemal tests are generally considered to be sensitive in early syphilis, but their disadvantage being false-positive reactions due to cross-reactivity with autoimmune diseases, collagen diseases and infections such as pian and leprosy.They also have false-negative reactions due to its reduced sensitivity in primary syphilis and late latent syphilis, (sensitivity: primary syphilis 78% to 86% In resource-limited settings, access to screening is limited and the risk of patients lost to follow-up is high (Taylor 2017).So, syphilis rapid tests to be applied at point of care (POC), which detect antibodies to Treponema pallidum antigen or anticardiolipin antibodies, have become popular in those settings due to their advantages: the quickness in giving results, the possibility of giving treatment immediately, are performed with minimal technical training in non-laboratory settings, and detect the disease at the clinical setting (PAHO 2015; Peeling 2004 ).In addition, as the test results are obtained on the same day, expressed in a qualitative way (detected or not detected) and treatment can be provided Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews right away.The risk of over-treatment given by false positives is less dangerous than the secondary risk of not treating the infection, so every patient with positive result must be given treatment (Jafari 2013) . In order to define the ideal characteristics of a rapid and POC test for the detection of sexually transmitted infections, the WHO Sexually Transmitted Diseases Diagnostic Initiative (SDI) established the ASSURED criteria: the test has to be A ordable, Sensitive, Specific, User-friendly, Rapid and Robust, Equipment-free and Delivered to end users.The setting of these criteria has the potential to make an impact in averting congenital syphilis in primary healthcare settings (Mabey 2012; Peeling 2006; Peeling 2010). There are two types of POC test: non-treponemal and treponemal. There is a device which o ers the ability to provide the antibody detection of both tests.In a recent meta-analysis the sensitivity of treponemal POC tests varied from 74.26% to 90.04% and specificity from 94.15% to 99.58% (Jafari 2013 ).The combined test has a sensitivity of 98.4% when the standard is a non-treponemal test (RPR) greater than 1:8 dilutions.but it has been seen that sensitivity falls to 88% when the RPR is negative (Singh 2015).Nevertheless, these recent metaanalysis are founded in the background of stored samples, with serologic status previously known, which may introduce biases in the outcomes, resulting in high sensitivities and specificities.Our review will look for studies with fresh samples. Series that compare syphilis POC tests with the combination of treponemal and non-treponemal tests, have shown a concordance with approximately 90.6%, with a specificity greater than 95% and a sensitivity between 60% to 100% depending on the test (Gaydos 2014) .The implementation of rapid testing must be accompanied by quality assurance systems and technical competence (Benzaken 2014) . The improvement in access to appropriate diagnosis and treatment for infectious diseases can reduce the burden of disease (Taylor 2017).Although some infections can be managed syndromically without the need for diagnostic tests, this is not appropriate for asymptomatic infectious diseases in which a positive diagnostic test is needed before treatment can be given (Peeling 2010). In many situations, it is not possible to perform or to wait for the results of laboratory tests, because the delay represents opportunities lost for treatment, which can spread the infection of the STD, therefore diagnosis depends on the availability of POC The second clinical scenario where the POC test could be used is in the case of symptomatic patients.In this population, the syphilis infection can be suspected by unspecific signs of infection, such as hard chancre, inguinal adenopathies, exanthema or condylomata lata.For these patients, the prompt confirmation accompanied by the immediate treatment of the disease could relieve the infection and break the chain of transmission, decreasing the infection rates (Gaydos 2014) . Considering the burden and economic costs associated with the condition, even in settings with low prevalence (Larson 2014) , it is highly desirable to undertake a critical appraisal of the available evidence of the diagnostic accuracy of the di erent syphilis rapid POC tests.There is therefore, a need for high-quality systematic reviews to improve the diagnosis of syphilis.This systematic review will facilitate the synthesis of the current evidence, and recognise the strengths and weaknesses, address the uncertainty of the current knowledge, and make it possible to assess the e ectiveness and safety of this intervention. Knowing the performance, advantages and limitations of the POC test, could facilitate the decision-making process at individual, organisational, and healthcare systems levels (Larson 2014) .The formulation of public health policy focused on early diagnostic and treatment of the infected patient, eliminating the treatment delays and cutting the infection spread, even in clinical settings can help to reduce the burden of syphilis (Singh 2015). To determine the diagnostic accuracy of rapid tests at point of care (POC) for detecting syphilis infection in men and nonpregnant women of reproductive age, as verified with the combination of both reactive non-treponemal and treponemal test as the reference standard. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. To assess the accuracy of rapid POC testing according to type (non-treponemal and treponemal), infection stage (active versus inactive) and setting (low/middle-income vs high-income countries).In addition, we will to determine the diagnostic accuracy of POC test by brand without realize a formal comparison. Criteria for considering studies for this review We will include accuracy studies.Participants in included studies should have been enrolled under field conditions, prospectively and consecutively or through random sampling.Only studies reporting that all participants received the index test and the reference standard and presenting 2 × 2 data will be eligible for inclusion.We will exclude diagnostic case-control studies because this is not an appropriate design for diagnostic test studies. We will include men and nonpregnant women at reproductive age, recruited at primary-or secondary-care facilities without previous diagnostic testing, who are attending an outpatient facility.We will not include pregnant women because there is another review with this population. Rapid tests at POC from whole blood, serum or plasma, regardless of the type of POC test (non-treponemal or treponemal) or technique (Immunochromatographic, agglutination or any other technology). A combination of both reactive non-treponemal (positive at any titre) and treponemal test (positive result). We will develop a highly-sensitive, systematic search strategy to identify as many relevant accuracy or validity studies, irrespective of their language, and publication status (published, unpublished, in press, and in progress).We will use both electronic searching in bibliographic databases and handsearching, as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011) . The results of all searches will be downloaded and managed using Endnote bibliographic so ware.Duplicate records of the same study will be deleted. We contacted with the Information Specialist of the Cochrane Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI) Review Group in order to implement a comprehensive search strategy to capture as many relevant studies as possible in electronic databases.For this purpose, we will use a combination of exploded controlled vocabulary (MeSH, Emtree, DeCS) and free-text terms (considering spelling variants, plurals, synonyms, acronyms and abbreviations) for the index tests (point-of-care test, point of care, point of care testing, point of care devices, point of care diagnostic, point of care laboratory, POC, POCT, rapid test, rapid test device, self testing, self test, patient self testing) and the target condition (syphilis, Treponema pallidum), with field labels, truncation, proximity operators and boolean operators.The search strategies and their results can be found in Appendix 1 (Electronic search strategies). Specifically, we will search the following electronic databases. • MEDLINE, Ovid platform: inception to present. We will attempted to identify additional relevant studies by using of the following methods. Two review authors (NT-M, LV-V) will independently selecting the titles and abstracts of studies retrieved as a result of the search.Disagreements will be resolved through consensus or, if required, by consultation with a third review author (CFG-A).We will retrieve the full text of a study if we have doubts about whether the study should be included or excluded.Two authors (EA-M, JA-G) will review independently the full text of selected articles in order to defined their inclusion.Disagreements will be resolved through consensus or, if required, by consultation with a third review author (CFG-A). We will design a data extraction form.For eligible studies, two review authors (EA-M, JA-G) will extract data independently using the form.Discrepancies will be resolved through consensus or, if required, by consultation with a third review author (CFG-A).The data extraction form will include the following information.We will collate and present this information in \\'Characteristics of included studies\\' tables.We will add the data to Review Manager 5.3 (Revman 2014), and two review authors (CFG-A, JA-G) will independently assess the accuracy of the data.Di erences will be resolved through consensus or by evaluation by a third review author (EA-M).When information regarding any of the above is unclear, we will contact the authors of the original reports to request further details. We will assess the quality of included articles by using a modified version of the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool (Whiting 2011).Two review authors (JA-G,EA-M ) will independently perform the quality assessment using the four key domains to assess risk of bias and concerns regarding the applicability to the research question (patient selection, index test, reference standard, and flow-timing domains).We will score the papers as having a \\'low\\', \\'high\\' or \\'unclear\\' risk of bias for each of four domains, and for the patient selection, index test and reference standard applicability.Studies classified at high or unclear risk of bias and/or high concern regarding applicability in at least one Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews domain will be regarded as having low methodological design.In the case of disagreements, di erences will be resolved through consensus or by consultation with a third review author (CFG-A).The results will be presented in graphics according to each study an as a summary of all the studies. We will to assess the accuracy of all POC available test for detecting syphilis infection regardless their type: treponemal or non-treponemal.In this sense we plan to look at their accuracy grouped.On the other hand, because currently there are two common approaches to the diagnosis of syphilis using serological tests: the traditional algorithm (begins the screening with a nontreponemal test and confirms a positive result with a treponemal test) and the reverse algorithm (utilises a treponemal primary screening assay followed by a non-treponemal test if the primary treponemal assay is positive) we plan to report POC test accuracy using as gold standard both approaches grouped by type and sequence. We will summarise diagnostic test accuracy by creating a 2 × 2 table for each study based on information retrieved directly from the papers.Each table will contain false-positive, false-negative, truepositive, and true-negative rates.Two review authors (CFG-A, JA-G) will independently enter the data into Revman 2014.Discrepancies will be resolved by consensus or, if required, by consultation with a third review author (EA-M). In the first instance, we will analyse in a descriptive way all data retrieved from the included studies.For this purpose and given that results of the POC are reported qualitatively (positive or negative), we will present the results by plotting their sensitivity and specificity (and their 95% confidence intervals) both in forest plots and in a scatter plot in receiver operating characteristic (ROC) space.For the meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy measures, we will use the bivariate model (Reitsma 2005) .For studies with a common threshold, this model takes into account withinstudy variation and between-study variation and focuses on estimating a summary operating point (i.e. a summary value for sensitivity and specificity).In addition, we will estimate the 95% confidence region and the 95% prediction region around the summary operating point.We will perform these analyses using the command xtmelogit in STATA, according to the licenses available. We will include a \\'Summary of findings\\' table using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach to diagnostic test accuracy (Hsu 2011) , using the template provided in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Diagnostic Test Accuracy (DTA) (Bossuyt 2013 ).We will present this summary table to provide a more accessible perspective of diagnostic information to healthcare providers and other end users. We will explore heterogeneity initially by performing visual inspection of forest plots of sensitivities and specificities and visual examination of the prediction region.We will formally assess the source of heterogeneity by examining di erences in diagnostic accuracy between subgroups of studies.Again, we will use the bivariate method to analyse how the summary estimate of sensitivity and specificity varies according to study level covariates. For this purpose, we will create a factor variable with N categories and will generate an N-1 dummy that will be entered into the bivariate model to test the e ects of covariates on both sensitivity and specificity (Bossuyt 2013 ). We will define the sources of heterogeneity a priori and will include the following factors: POC type (non-treponemal and treponemal), infection stage (active versus inactive) and setting (low/middleincome vs high-income countries).In addition, we will to realize a subgroup analyses in order to determine the diagnostic accuracy of POC test by brand, without incurring a formal comparison. We will perform sensitivity analysis for aspects of the review that might a ect the results, such as risk of bias associated with the quality of included trials based on an overall \\'Risk of bias\\' assessment (low versus unclear and high risk of bias) according to QUADAS-2 patient selection, index test, reference standard, and flow-timing domains. We will investigate publication bias if we find 10 or more studies for inclusion in this systematic review.We will investigate reporting bias by using the natural logarithm of the DOR (lnDOR) and plot it against its variance or SE.We will assess asymmetry visually, and if asymmetry is suggested by a visual assessment, we will perform exploratory analyses using Deeks\\' test to investigate the asymmetry and using diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) as a measure of test accuracy (van Enst 2014).

In a population-based cohort, AMH did not have associations with leukocyte telomere length, mtDNA copy number, or intrinsic EAA. (\\nBody Text: eproductive aging in women consists of a steady loss of ovarian follicles through atresia or ovulation (1) .Reproductive aging in the late premenopause may be reflected in the lower levels of blood antim€ ullerian hormone (AMH), a protein produced by viable ovarian follicles (2) .Women with accelerated reproductive aging may be at risk of more rapid aging in other organ systems: younger age at menopause increases the risk of mortality and cardiovascular events (3) , and lower AMH levels and more rapid AMH declines increase the risk of cardiovascular events (4) .The mechanism for these associations remains unknown.The declines in estradiol levels that characterize menopause led to the hypothesis that estrogen therapy may delay or reverse adverse changes in the vasculature (5) .However, trials of estrogen therapy have not demonstrated consistent benefit on cardiovascular outcomes (5, 6) or intermediate markers of disease (7) (8) (9) .Thus, others have hypothesized that reproductive aging and adverse effects in other organ systems may be linked by mechanisms other than sex hormones (10) . Such mechanisms may include mechanisms implicated in aging, for example, accelerated loss of telomere length (11) , more rapid reductions in mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid (mtDNA) copy number (12) , and epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) (10) .Telomeres are DNA-protein complexes that shorten with each cell division, and loss of telomeric repeats eventually leads to cellular senescence (13) .Mitochondria are cellular organelles that generate energy, and advancing age is believed to lead to cumulative damage in mtDNA, resulting in lower mtDNA copy number (14) .Other aging markers include \\'\\'epigenetic clocks\\'\\' on the basis of DNA methylation signatures that are correlated with chronological age and predict time to death.Calculations of intrinsic EAA reflect the difference between chronological age and 1 method for calculating epigenetic age that may reflect cellintrinsic aging processes and are independent of changes in blood cell composition (15) , whereas calculations of extrinsic EAA may reflect the difference between chronological age and another method for calculating epigenetic age that may reflect immune system aging (16) . Few studies have examined whether reproductive aging is associated with aging biomarkers.Women with primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) have shorter leukocyte telomere length (17) (18) (19) and decreased mtDNA copy number (20, 21) than women without POI, and younger age at menopause is correlated with older epigenetic age (10, 22) .Thus, it is unknown whether reproductive aging in the premenopause is correlated with and predicts declines in leukocyte aging biomarkers in later life and whether associations persist in cohorts other than women with POI. Therefore, we conducted a longitudinal analysis of the relationship between AMH and subsequent 10-year declines in telomere length and mtDNA copy number and 5-year changes in intrinsic and extrinsic EAA.Since 1985, the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study has performed periodic examinations of a population-based cohort of non-Hispanic whites and African Americans, including at years 15 (2000-2001) , 20 (2005-2006) , and 25 (2010-2011) (23, 24) .The CARDIA Study assessed AMH at examination year 15/16, when women were approximately 40 years of age.We hypothesized that lower AMH levels would be cross-sectionally associated with shorter telomere length and lower mtDNA copy number at year 15/16 and with greater declines in telomere length and mtDNA copy number between years 15 and 25 after adjustment for chronological age.We also hypothesized that lower AMH levels would be cross-sectionally associated with faster intrinsic and extrinsic EAA at year 15 and faster EAA between years 15 and 20. The CARDIA Study and CARDIA Women\\'s Study have been previously described in detail (23, 24) .Briefly, CARDIA participants aged 18-30 years were recruited from the populations of Birmingham, Chicago, Minneapolis, and northern California, and baseline examinations were performed in 5,115 individuals (2,788 women) in 1985-1986.The population was balanced according to age, sex, race, and educational attainment at each site.Institutional review boards at each study center approved the study, and written informed consent was obtained from participants. The CARDIA Women\\'s Study (n ¼ 1,163) was an ancillary study to the CARDIA Study designed to examine the associations between androgens, polycystic ovaries, and associated clinical features with subclinical atherosclerosis (25) .Eligibility criteria in the CARDIA Women\\'s Study included attendance at the year 15 CARDIA examination (2001 15 CARDIA examination ( -2002)) , presence of at least 1 ovary, and lack of current pregnancy.For the current report, potentially eligible participants were the CARDIA Women\\'s Study participants with AMH levels determined at year 15 (n ¼ 1,054).Women who had undergone hysterectomy by year 15 (n ¼ 95), had experienced natural menopause by year 15 (n ¼ 8), were pregnant at the time of the year 15 examination (n ¼ 2), or had missing model or exclusionary covariables (n ¼ 9) were excluded.Also excluded were women with polycystic ovary syndrome (n ¼ 69) defined as combined hyperandrogenism (total testosterone levels of R80 ng/dL or free testosterone levels of R0.75 ng/dL or unwanted hair growth) and irregular menses between the ages of 18 and 30 years (26) .After these exclusions, a total of 871 participants had available AMH data along with the variables of age, smoking status, body mass index (BMI), and oral contraceptive pill (OCP) use (Fig. 1 ).None of the women experienced cessation of menses before the age of 40 years (i.e., experienced POI or premature menopause).In separate ancillary studies, telomere length and mtDNA copy number were assessed in 620 women, in which participants with stored DNA from whole blood available at years 15 and 25 and had coronary artery calcification data on the same examination were selected.Women underwent epigenomic profiling at years 15 and 20.For the purposes of this report, we included women who had year 15 AMH data available and underwent measurement of telomere length, mtDNA copy number, or epigenomic profiling.Women with all aging measures were similar to women with no aging measures or only a subset of aging measures regarding the AMH levels, smoking use, number of pregnancies, oral contraceptive use, and BMI.Women with all measures available were slightly older than those without any or only a few measures (40.7 vs. 39.8 vs. 39.8 years, respectively; P¼ .02),and women with all measures or some measures were less likely to be White than women with no measures (44% vs. 46% vs. 54%, P¼ .02). The measurement of telomere length and mtDNA copy number in CARDIA has been described in detail previously (27) .Briefly, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid-containing aliquots were stored at À70 C until shipped on dry ice to the genetics laboratory of Dr. Myriam Fornage at the University of Texas Health Science Center (Houston, TX).The DNA for leukocyte telomere length was prepared with the Gentra Puregene Cell Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA), and DNA samples were shipped in 96-well plates to the University of California San Francisco Blackburn laboratory.The telomere length values were measured from DNA by a quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay that determines the ratio of telomere repeat copy number to single-copy gene copy number in experimental samples compared with a reference DNA sample (28) .A higher ratio signified a longer mean telomere length.The ratio was converted into base pairs with the following formula: base pairs ¼ 3,274 þ 2,413 Â (the ratio).The interassay coefficient of variation (CV) was 3.5% (standard deviation, 2.1%). The leukocyte mtDNA copy number was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction using previously described methods (27, 29) , which determined the relative number of mtDNA copies per diploid nuclear genome (i.e., per cell).The VIC-labeled probe and primer set for RNase P were obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA).The relative copy number was calculated using the following formula: relative mtDNA copy number/diploid genome ¼ POWER[2,(CPND1-CPRNaseP)]*2.The interassay CV on the basis of 85 CARDIA samples was 3.4%, and the intraassay CV on the basis of 4 control DNA samples, averaged from all 21 CARDIA sample plates, was 1.7%. Epigenomic profiling in the CARDIA Study has been previously described (30) .Briefly, the DNA methylation levels at years 15 and 20 were estimated using the Illumina Methyla-tionEPIC BeadChip (approximately 850,000 sites).Epigenetic age acceleration was calculated using 2 methods available through Horvath epigenetic age calculator (15) .Intrinsic EAA was estimated from the residuals from a linear regression model of epigenetic age regressed on chronological age and numerous blood immune cell counts, and extrinsic EAA was estimated by calculating the residuals from a linear regression model of epigenetic age regressed on chronological age, up-weighting age-related blood cell counts (15, 16) . In 2014, the AMH level was measured in stored serum samples from the 2002-2003 (year 16) visit using Ansh Labs (Webster, TX) ultrasensitive AMH enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay platform at the clinical reference laboratory, ReproSource (Woburn, MA) (31) .The clinical lower limit of detection was 0.02 ng/dL; the intraassay and interassay CVs ranged between 3% and 7% and between 5% and 10%, respectively.At each visit, standardized questionnaires and examinations included assessment of smoking, OCP use, and BMI calculated from standard anthropometric protocols (32) . Antim€ ullerian hormone was characterized by quartile because it may have a nonlinear association with chronic disease (33) , with women in the highest and lowest levels at greater risk of poor outcomes.The characteristics of women by AMH quartile at year 15 were described using (n) frequencies for categorical variables and means (standard deviations) or median (interquartile range) for quantitative variables with normal and skewed distributions, respectively (Table 1 ).Next, using linear regression models, we examined the association between AMH quartile at year 15 with telomere length; mtDNA copy number; intrinsic and extrinsic EAA at years 15, 20, and 25; and change between these years (Table 2 ).Separate models were created for each biomarker of aging and timepoint at which that biomarker was measured.Models were adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, and smoking status.These covariates were selected because of their associations with AMH in previous CARDIA analyses, whereas OCP use and BMI were not shown to be strongly associated with AMH (23, 31) .However, in sensitivity analyses, we examined whether there were changes in the patterns of effects with the addition of these variables in the models.We also performed analyses where the dependent variables, that is, telomere length, mtDNA copy number, and EAA estimates, were log-transformed; the pattern and significance of associations were similar, and therefore, the nontransformed results are presented for ease of interpretation.We evaluated models that were not adjusted for chronological age to determine whether AMH was associated with peripheral aging markers after consideration of race and smoking status.We examined whether the addition of year 15 markers to the models changed the associations between AMH and change in markers.Finally, we modeled the relationship between AMH and aging markers using the piecewise linear function in STATA mkspline, placing knots at the cutpoint for each quartile.Analyses were performed using the Statistical Analysis Software version 9.2 (SAS Institute; Cary, NC), and all tests were 2-sided with statistical significance set at a prespecified level of P< .05. Of the 385 women included in the study, 46% (n ¼ 177) and 54% (n ¼ 208) reported Black and White races, respectively.Black women were younger than White women (39.3 vs. 40.9years, P< .0001)and more likely to have never smoked (64% vs. 51%).Table 1 shows the characteristics of women at year 15 by AMH quartile.In unadjusted comparisons, women in the highest AMH quartile were younger, more likely to be Black, and more likely to have never smoked (Table 1 ).Aging markers, including markers at year 15 and change in markers between year 15 and subsequent years, did not vary by AMH quartile.The exception was that women in the lowest AMH quartile had lower extrinsic EAA than women in the highest AMH quartile.In other words, women in the lowest AMH quartile had slower epigenetic aging in relation to chronological aging than women in the highest AMH quartile.Women in the highest AMH quartile had higher mtDNA copy number than women in lower quartiles, although the association was borderline in significance (P¼ .051). Table 2 shows the associations between AMH quartile and aging markers, adjusted for age, race, and smoking history.We did not observe significant associations or patterns in the association between AMH and aging markers.The single exception was that women in the second AMH quartile had accelerated epigenetic aging as represented by extrinsic EAA compared with women in the first AMH quartile.However, women in the third and fourth AMH quartiles did not have different extrinsic EAA estimates compared with women in the first quartile.Of note, the association between AMH and extrinsic EAA did not persist after log-transformation of EAA in sensitivity analysis (Supplemental Table 1 , available online) or vary by AMH quartile using piecewise linear regression. In sensitivity analyses, AMH was not associated with peripheral aging markers either before or after adjustment for chronological age (Supplemental Table 2 ), suggesting that the relationship between AMH and these markers in late premenopausal women is not strong (available online).In addition, models adjusting for BMI and OCP use did not alter the associations between AMH and aging markers (Supplemental Table 3 , available online).When the dependent variable was change in aging marker between baseline and follow-up year, the addition of the baseline marker did not change the associations between AMH and change in markers (Supplemental Table 4 , available online).Finally, when we modeled the association between AMH and aging markers using piecewise linear regression adjusting for age, race, and smoking history, coefficients were not significant, indicating that the association between AMH quartile and aging markers did not vary significantly by AMH quartile. In a population-based cohort of late reproductive-age women, we found that reproductive age as indicated by the AMH levels was correlated with chronological age but not independently associated with leukocyte measures of aging, including telomere length, mtDNA copy number, and EAA.Antim€ ullerian hormone did not have cross-sectional associations with these markers, nor did it predict declines in these markers after consideration of chronological age as well as race and cigarette use.The exception was that women in the second AMH quartile had faster extrinsic EAA than women in the lowest quartile, although the significance of this association is unclear given the lack of associations in other quartiles along with the lack of association between AMH and future extrinsic EAA and change in extrinsic EAA.Our report is notable in that no studies have examined the relationship between AMH and aging markers in population-based samples or over an extended time period. Previous studies have focused on the associations between aging biomarkers and presence or absence of POI.Several of these reports on the basis of small samples note that a lower AMH level is correlated with shorter telomere length among women with (19) and without (17, 18) polymorphisms for the FMR1 gene that confers the increased risk of POI.However, one study reported that women with POI had longer, rather than shorter, telomere length than controls (34) .Along similar lines, women of advanced reproductive age more often have abnormal mitochondria than younger women, but follicular mtDNA copy number has been higher (35, 36) or similar (37) to that of younger women.Bonomi et al. (20) reported that leukocyte mtDNA copy number and follicular mtDNA copy number were highly correlated (R 2 ¼ 0.55; P¼ .008)and that women with POI had lower leukocyte mtDNA copy number than women with normal ovarian reserve.Correlations with AMH were not examined.Others have also reported correlations between follicular mtDNA copy number and presence of POI, without examination of POI (21) .However, it is unclear whether women with POI who are being assessed for infertility have similar relationships between aging markers and ovarian reserve as a general population of women. Because of previously reported associations between age at menopause and epigenetic age (10, 22) , it has been hypothesized that menopause and epigenetic age are driven by similar determinants of aging (10) .The extent to which this can be detected before menopause is uncertain.We did not find consistent relationships between premenopausal indicators of reproductive age and leukocyte aging markers.Thus, it is possible that the association between menopause and epigenetic age is driven by the postmenopausal estrogen deficiency that affects cellular aging pathways (38) .It is also possible that premenopausal reproductive aging still occurs via these aging markers, but this relationship is stronger when markers are assessed in ovarian follicles rather than leukocytes.Olsen et al. (39) characterized the epigenome in granulosa cells and leukocytes in women with and without diminished ovarian reserve, noting that ovarian reserve status was not reflected in leukocyte epigenetic profile, even as the follicular cells had distinctive epigenetic patterns consistent with aging.Along similar lines, Morin et al. (40) reported that women with diminished ovarian reserve had different telomere length and epigenetic age in ovarian follicles compared with those in leukocytes.Finally, it is possible that reproductive aging relies on different aging processes other than those we examined. Other mechanisms aside from those mentioned in this report have been implicated in reproductive aging.We have previously reported that oxidative stress, as represented by serum F2-isoprostanes, is associated with lower AMH levels among CARDIA participants (41) , although the limitations of that analysis were similar to the present analysis, that is, measurement of AMH at a single point in time, with need for verification in a longitudinal analysis and ideally in a trial addressing oxidative stress reduction. In addition, the PI3K/PTEN/AKT/FOXO3 and associated tuberous sclerosis protein complex /mammalian target of rapamycin pathways are central to the regulation of the primordial follicle pool (42) .Other aging-associated systems, such as the insulin-like growth factor 1/growth hormone pathway and transsulfuration/hydrogen sulfide pathways, may also play a role (42) .Sirtuins aid in maintaining developmental metabolic competence and chromosomal integrity of the oocyte (42) .Finally, alternate epigenetic age calculators, conditioned on biomarkers correlated with aging, predict age at menopause among other incident chronic diseases (43) ; it is possible that these calculators may be more sensitive for ovarian aging than the calculators that we examined, which were conditioned on mortality. The strengths of this report include its population-based biracial cohort, characterization of ovarian reserve with a marker that is more robust to assessment across the menstrual cycle, and longitudinal assessment of leukocyte aging markers.Participants in the CARDIA Women\\'s Study and in this subanalysis were of late reproductive age, when the AMH level typically declines; AMH typically becomes undetectable in the few years preceding the final menstrual period.It is possible that associations between ovarian reserve and molecular aging markers are stronger at younger ages, particularly if these aging markers reflected a process that influenced ovarian reserve during sensitive periods, such as in utero exposure or early childhood.Previous reports note that in utero and early childhood deprivation are linked to early age at the final menstrual period (44) .In other words, aging markers may be related to the peak of AMH levels rather than AMH levels during a time when the AMH level declines.Although the range of the AMH level was typical of a population-based cohort, it may have been narrower than those of populations seeking fertility care or with chronic disease, and stronger associations may have been observed with wider ranges of AMH levels.Limitations include the assessment of AMH at only one point in time, and thus, we were unable to assess whether the relationship between reproductive aging and somatic aging was bidirectional.The CARDIA Study did not assess exposures that could decrease AMH levels, such as radiation or chemotherapy, although the incidence of cancer in this population-based cohort was low (45) .We focused on plasma AMH as a premenopausal marker of reproductive aging because a previous analysis demonstrated its greater predictive ability for menopause compared with folliclestimulating hormone or antral follicle count (23) .However, it is possible that other markers of reproductive aging, including follicular hormone levels and oocyte morphology, are associated with peripheral aging markers, whereas the plasma AMH levels were not.These follicle markers may be superior for their prediction of success with assisted reproduction, although their ability to predict menopause is unclear.The choice of optimal marker likely depends on what outcome is used to represent reproductive aging.The sample size of this study may have resulted in limited statistical power.Finally, as is true for epidemiologic studies, our observations may have been due to residual confounding and cannot prove causation. In conclusion, premenopausal reproductive aging as indicated by AMH was a not a predictor of leukocyte aging markers beyond chronological age.Future studies could examine whether repeated reproductive aging markers, such as AMH, rather than AMH at the late reproductive stage predict peripheral aging.Future studies should examine whether other aging pathways are linked with reproductive aging aside from telomere length, mtDNA copy number, and EAA.Future studies could also examine whether other factors characterizing the menopause, aside from ovarian reserve markers, affect peripheral aging markers.Such factors include hypothalamic-pituitary hormones, such as folliclestimulating hormone; adipose tissue redistribution; sleep disturbance and vasomotor symptoms; and alterations in metabolic profile.

Result(s): \\'\\'Infertile\\'\\' (n ¼ 926) and \\'\\'Non-infertile\\'\\' (n ¼ 214) patients were stratified on the basis of AMH levels, with low-AMH defined as <1.1 ng/mL in accordance with the Bologna criteria.Age-adjusted regression models showed no relationship between AMH classification and proportion of euploid, mosaic, and aneuploid embryos in the Infertile or Non-infertile cohorts.In the Infertile cohort, no association between AMH classification and embryo ploidy rates was identified in a subgroup analysis of patients aged <35 years, 35-37 years, and 38-39 years.These findings persisted in a sensitivity analysis of infertile patients stratified into AMH (ng/mL) quartile categories. No association was found between AMH and the proportion of euploid, mosaic, or aneuploid embryos in 2 large cohorts of patients undergoing IVF with PGT-A (Infertile patients) or PGT-A and PGT-M (Non-infertile patients), suggesting that a quantitative depletion of ovarian reserve does not predict the ploidy status of the embryo cohort.\\nBody Text: R eduction in both quantitative (i.e., absolute number of follicles) and qualitative (i.e., chromosomal integrity of oocytes) measures of ovarian reserve are 2 main features of female infertility.Although the negative effect of age on the quantity and quality of oocytes is well established, it is currently unknown whether these processes share a direct relationship or occur independently (1, 2) .It has previously been theorized that the decline in oocyte quality with age may be affected by an altered hormonal environment produced by a quantitatively diminished ovarian reserve (DOR) (3) .Whether indeed reduced ovarian reserve may lead to reduced oocyte quality is an active question with important clinical implications, not only for women who choose to delay childbearing but also for women who experience an early decline of their follicular pool. Quantitatively, estimates of ovarian reserve are relatively simple to measure and include serum antim€ ullerian hormone (AMH), a transforming growth factor-b glycoprotein hormone produced by granulosa cells and antral follicle count measured by ultrasound (4) (5) (6) .Qualitatively, the evaluation of oocyte integrity is far more challenging.In natural conception protocols, measures such as fecundity, time to pregnancy, and rate of miscarriage as well as aneuploid pregnancies have been used as proxies for oocyte quality based on the principle that high quality oocytes translate into more favorable outcomes.To date, attempts to correlate these qualitative measures with ovarian reserve have produced inconclusive findings.While some studies suggest a decline in fecundity and cumulative live birth rate, and an increase in fetal chromosomal aneuploidy and miscarriage risk among women with a quantitatively reduced ovarian pool others show no association, thus pointing toward 2 separate physiologic processes (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) . Preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT-A) offers a unique opportunity to investigate the quantityquality relationship using blastocyst ploidy as a qualitative marker in women treated with in vitro fertilization (IVF).To date, studies in this space were limited by small sample sizes and variable quantitative measures, producing inconclusive results (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) .Recently, 2 large studies of women undergoing IVF with PGT-A reported conflicting findings (24, 25) .One of the studies found that women with DOR had a 24% reduced odds of a biopsied blastocyst being euploid compared with women without DOR (25) .However, groups in this study were not age-matched despite an age difference of 2.5 years, and DOR was defined clinically using the Bologna criteria such that various confounding parameters were selected for in the sample, obscuring the specific interaction between oocyte quantity and euploidy rates (26) .Importantly, both studies focused on the infertile population, thereby limiting the relevance of these findings to women without an infertility diagnosis. The primary aim of this study was to determine whether AMH is associated with embryo euploidy rates obtained by PGT-A independently of age.To this end, we compared ploidy rates in women stratified by AMH levels in 2 subpopulations of patients: the general population of women pursuing IVF with PGT-A (\\'\\'Infertile\\'\\' group) and women pursuing IVF with preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic disorders (PGT-M) because of the risk for hereditary monogenic diseases (\\'\\'Non-infertile\\'\\' group).By conducting 2 separate analyses, we aimed to refine our characterization of the quantity-quality relationship beyond what had been achieved in the past.To our knowledge, this is the first time that a PGT-M population, presumed to share the reproductive potential of the general population, has been studied in this context. Approval for this study was obtained from the institutional review board at our institution.The study population included women who underwent oocyte retrieval with trophectoderm biopsy and PGT-A in an academic hospital setting between March 2012 and June 2020.All patients had an AMH level measured within 12 months of the oocyte retrieval.Patients who underwent fresh embryo transfers, and thus did not have PGT-A, were excluded.Patients of advanced maternal age according to the Bologna criteria (age R40 years) were excluded to account for advancing age as a confounder of the relationship between AMH level and euploidy rate (26, 27) .Embryos with inconclusive PGT-A results (insufficient DNA for testing/findings requiring re-biopsy) were excluded from the analysis, and the total number of tested blastocysts for the patient was appropriately adjusted.Only the patient\\'s first cycle with PGT-A was included to avoid selection bias toward patients with recurrent IVF failure or recurrent pregnancy loss.Data were collected from our prospectively maintained IVF electronic medical record system.Missing data were verified in the electronic medical record. Patients were stratified into \\'\\'Infertile\\'\\' and \\'\\'Non-infertile\\'\\' groups based on their indication for PGT-A.The infertile group included patients with a history of infertility, defined as failure to achieve a pregnancy after 12 months or more of regular unprotected intercourse or after 6 months for women aged 35 and older, who primarily utilized PGT-A for embryo selection before embryo transfer.The decision to use PGT-A for the purpose of embryo selection was made by the patient after thorough counseling with their treating physician regarding the risks and benefits of this technique.The Noninfertile group included patients who primarily underwent ovarian stimulation with intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) for the purpose of PGT-M owing to the risk for hereditary monogenic disease, but additionally elected to use PGT-A for embryo selection.In this group, PGT-A was chosen by the patient after counseling by the treating physician as described above. Cycle parameters analyzed included patient age at the time of oocyte retrieval; number of oocytes and metaphase-II (MII) oocytes retrieved; number of 2 pronuclear zygotes; number of blastocysts biopsied; and the number of euploid, aneuploid, and mosaic embryos in each patient\\'s cohort. The ovarian stimulation treatment was performed following the standard protocols at our institution.Most patients were treated with a gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist protocol (28) .For patients with a predicted poor response to stimulation, clomiphene citrate or letrozole was added or a GnRH agonist flare protocol was used at the discretion of the treating physician (29) (30) (31) .In patients with DOR, estrogen priming was initiated in the midluteal phase of the cycle before the ovarian stimulation cycle with 0.1 mg estradiol patches (Climara 0.1 mg, Bayer HealthCare) (32) .The ovulatory trigger was administered once there were 2 leading follicles that had reached 17 mm in size (20 mm for clomiphene and 22-24 mm for letrozole-based protocols).Either an human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)-only trigger (Novarel [Ferring Pharmaceuticals Inc., Parsippany, NJ, USA] or Pregnyl [Merck, Whitehouse Station, NJ, USA]) or a dual trigger with hCG and GnRH agonist (leuprolide acetate) was administered, with hCG dosing based on a previously published sliding-scale protocol (33) .Oocyte retrieval was performed transvaginally under ultrasound guidance approximately 35-37 hours after the ovulatory trigger was administered. Oocyte insemination was performed by ICSI unless declined by the patient.ICSI was performed first by mechanically denuding the oocytes to assess nuclear maturity, followed by the injection of mature oocytes with a single sperm.Embryos were cultured in sequential media using the EmbryoScope (Vitrolife, G€ oteburg, Sweden) time-lapse system.Embryos were evaluated for fertilization on day 1 and graded morphologically on days 3 and 5 (34) . Embryos that reached the blastocyst stage were biopsied for PGT-A analysis.The trophectoderm biopsy was performed by first stabilizing the embryo with a holding pipette and then perforating the zona pellucida with laser pulsation (ZI-LOS-tk Laser).A biopsy pipette (20 mm internal diameter) was then used to aspirate 3-7 cells.Biopsied embryos were then cryopreserved for future use (35) .Patients in the Infertile group had PGT-A performed in our laboratory as previously described (36) .Patients who underwent PGT-A simultaneously with PGT-M (Non-infertile group) had their specimens analyzed at 1 of 3 commercial laboratories using either single nucleotide polymorphism microarray, array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH), or next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology.Normal, aneuploid, and mosaic results were then reported. The primary outcomes of this study were proportion of euploid embryos per ovarian stimulation cycle.Secondary outcomes included number of biopsied blastocysts, number of euploid embryos, and proportions of mosaic and aneuploid embryos per ovarian stimulation cycle.The Infertile and the Non-infertile groups were analyzed separately.Within each cohort, patients with AMH <1.1 ng/mL were compared with the patients with AMH R1.1 ng/mL in accordance with the Bologna criteria.A Poisson regression model was used to evaluate the association between AMH group and the number of biopsied blastocysts and euploid embryos.Results are presented as relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).For all ploidy rates outcomes, a Poisson regression model with number of biopsied blastocysts as offset term was used to evaluate the association between AMH group and proportion of euploid, mosaic, and aneuploid embryos.Results are presented as relative rates with 95% CI.All analyses were adjusted a priori for patient age and for the ovarian stimulation protocol type.To assess the relationship between AMH and aneuploidy more closely within prespecified age groups previously found to be related to aneuploidy rates, subgroup analyses of patients aged <35 years, 35-37 years, and 38-39 years were performed for the Infertile group using the Poisson regression models described above (37) .In addition, patients in the Infertile group were stratified into quartile categories by AMH (ng/mL), and analyses were repeated.Sensitivity analyses by age and AMH quartile were not performed for the Non-infertile group owing to the smaller size of the cohort.Statistical analyses were performed using Python (version 3.8.1)and associated numerical packages (pandas, statsmodels, matplotlib). This study consisted of 1,140 patients who underwent their first cycle of IVF with trophectoderm biopsy and PGT-A.Patients were placed into \\'\\'Infertile\\'\\' (n ¼ 926) or \\'\\'Non-infertile\\'\\' (n ¼ 214) groups and stratified based on the AMH levels, with low-AMH defined as <1.analyzed.There was a statistically significant increase in the number of biopsied blastocysts as well as the number of euploid embryos with each increasing AMH quartile for the entire cohort and all 3 age subgroups.Euploidy rates for each AMH quartile by age group are also shown in Figure 1 . The euploidy rate for each AMH quartile was comparable to the lowest AMH quartile when all patients were analyzed together and in the 3 age subgroups.Similarly, no significant relationship was observed between percentage of mosaic and aneuploid embryos and AMH classification across age groups. The Non-infertile sample included patients tested for a total of 24 disorders in the low-AMH group (n ¼ 34), and 81 disorders in the group with normal-AMH levels (n ¼ 180), with few patients tested for more than one disease.Overall, among Poisson regression models adjusted a priori for age and stimulation type to estimate the relative risk (95% confidence interval).a Poisson regression models with biopsied blastocysts as offset term adjusted a priori for age and stimulation type to estimate the relative rate (95% confidence interval). 3 presents the age-adjusted analysis performed for Non-infertile patients.Similar to the Infertile group, the number of biopsied blastocysts and euploid embryos was statistically increased in normal-AMH compared with low-AMH patients (Biopsied blastocysts: 7.0 vs. 3.4,RR, 1.98 [95% CI, 1.63-2.41];Euploid embryos: 3.9 vs. 1.6;RR, 2.46 [95% CI, 1.84-3.28]).Euploidy rate was higher in the normal-AMH group (54.6%) compared with low-AMH group (47.8%); however, this relationship was not significant after adjusting for age and stimulation type.Again, no significant relationship was observed between percentage of mosaic and aneuploid embryos and AMH group. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether an association exists between quantitatively reduced ovarian reserve, measured using AMH levels, and oocyte quality, measured using embryo euploidy rates identified on PGT-A.In our study cohort, we observed no relationship between AMH classification and euploidy rates among women classified as either \\'\\'Infertile\\'\\' or \\'\\'Non-infertile\\'\\'.Likewise, there were no statistically significant associations between AMH level category and proportion of mosaic or aneuploid embryos in either population.Expectedly, a significantly higher number of biopsied blastocysts and absolute number of euploid embryos were seen in the normal compared with low-AMH categories in both the \\'\\'Infertile\\'\\' and \\'\\'Non-infertile\\'\\' groups, consistent with the response to stimulation based on the ovarian reserve.These findings persisted in age-appropriate subgroup analyses and in a sensitivity analysis of the infertile group by AMH quartiles. Our findings address a present uncertainty in the field concerning the mechanisms that drive ovarian aging.It is currently unknown whether a quantitative reduction in the follicular pool contributes to factors that compromise oocyte quality.Our results suggest that the quantitative and qualitative decline in ovarian reserve seen in reproductive aging reflect 2 separate physiologic processes, both in women who experience fertility barriers and in women who are presumed to share the reproductive potential of the general population.These results are consistent with a previous large study that evaluated patients who underwent IVF with PGT-A and found no association between AMH and euploidy rates (24) .Conversely, our findings conflict with those of another recent investigation which reported a significant reduction in euploidy rates among women with a clinical diagnosis of DOR vs. women without DOR (25) .Although the investigators attempted to control for age using a generalized linear model, the DOR group was on average 2.5 years older, the sample was inclusive of women up to 42 years old, and DOR was defined clinically without the use of a single quantitative metric.The strengths of our study include comparisons by AMH quartiles and age-appropriate subgroup analyses which were performed to best account for advancing age as a confounder of the relationship between AMH level and euploidy rate.These sensitivity analyses add important nuance to our findings; namely, the nonsignificant trend toward high euploidy rates among patients with higher AMH levels (AMH R1.1 ng/mL or higher AMH quartile [2nd, 3rd, or 4th]) was consistently driven by women in the older age categories in our sample (35-37 and 38-39 years) and was not observed in women younger than 35.This observation further corroborates our conclusion that factors linked to age rather than reduced ovarian reserve drive reduction in oocyte quality. An important distinguishing feature of our study is the focus on women pursuing IVF with PGT-M due to the risk of hereditary monogenic diseases (Non-infertile group).To date, investigations which target the quantity-quality relationship in reproductive aging have overwhelmingly focused on the infertile population, rendering the general population of women without an infertility diagnosis relatively understudied.Our finding that AMH is also not associated with euploidy rates in this population is in contrast with a previous study that evaluated 53 women undergoing IVF for the purpose of gender selection without evidence of a concomitant infertility diagnosis using fluorescence in situ hybridization for 7 chromosomes (X, Y, 13, 16, 18, 21, 22) (38) .Here, we report a substantial cohort size of 214 women using platforms more consistent with the current standard of care used for PGT-A analysis. Although based on our findings, the quantitative decline in the follicular pool and qualitative reduction in ovarian reserve are not associated, these 2 processes may still interact in important ways.Recently, converging evidence from mammalian models have pointed toward inflammation as a key player in the mechanisms that drive decreased oocyte quality (39) (40) (41) .Based on this theory, low-grade, chronic inflammation, a feature of both natural aging and several pathologies associated with DOR such as obesity and autoimmunity, may give rise to chromosomally abnormal oocytes by way of chronic exposure to free radicals and oxidative damage to the ovary (42, 43) .This perspective which ties quanti-tative and qualitative ovarian decline to a pathophysiology shared by aging but not limited to it, is an intriguing alternative to theories which point to the diminished follicular pool as the causal agent which compromises oocyte quality. We acknowledge several limitations of this study.First, we evaluated oocyte quality based on the chromosome status of embryos using PGT-A technology which has undergone rapid evolution over the time period of the study.As the different technological platforms represented in our sample are reflective of progressive refinements of aneuploidy testing over the past decade, this limitation is unavoidable.However, agreement across technologies has been found to be overwhelmingly high (44) .Second, as this was a retrospective study, factors such as previous reproductive history or a desire to mitigate miscarriage risk likely played a role in the decision to perform PGT-A by the treating physician and the patient.Third, patients were classified as Infertile or Non-infertile based on their primary indication for PGT; however, it is possible that some patients in the Non-infertile group additionally had a secondary history of infertility that we were unable to capture.Lastly, although our study is among the largest to be published in this space, encompassing the entire population who underwent PGT-A at our center since the introduction of trophectoderm biopsy and until the present time, sample size remains a limitation.Especially with respect to the Non-infertile cohort, although we report the first substantial cohort of patients without an infertility diagnosis, the sample size is still relatively small which limits the level of nuance we are powered to detect.Future studies with large cohorts of patients without an infertility diagnosis would be necessary to test this important clinical question at a superior resolution. In summary, our results did not demonstrate a relationship between AMH and proportion of euploid, mosaic, or TABLE 3 Association between antim€ ullerian hormone and embryo ploidy in \\'\\'Non-infertile\\'\\' preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic disorders (PGT-M) with preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT-A) patients. \\'\\'Non-infertile\\'\\' (PGT-M with PGT-A) AMH (ng/mL) <1.1 ( Poisson regression models adjusted a priori for age and stimulation type to estimate the relative risk (95% confidence interval).Data are mean AE standard error.AMH ¼ antim€ ullerian hormone; PGT-M ¼ preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic/single-gene defects; PGT-A ¼ preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy.a Poisson regression models with biopsied blastocysts as offset term adjusted a priori for age and stimulation type to estimate the relative rate (95% confidence interval).

VOL. 119 NO. 3 / MARCH 2023 Fertility and Sterility®\\n\\n==================================================\\n\\nFile: Apples,-oranges,-and-ectopic-pregnancies_2023_fns.grobid.tei.json\\nTitle: Apples, oranges, and ectopic pregnancies\\nAuthors: Jessica [\\'A\\'] Meyer, Gwendolyn [\\'P\\'] Quinn, Christina [\\'A\\'] Penfield\\nAbstract: \\nBody Text: Consumption of research is an important component of a well-balanced diet for medical providers, researchers, and laypeople alike.Practicing evidence-based medicine relies on integrating the best available science into clinical practice, thereby aiming to improve outcomes by providing the highest quality of care.Similarly, conducting meaningful research relies on a thorough inventory of what is currently known in the literature, quality assessment of methods, and the ability to design new studies that fill knowledge gaps and answer relevant questions.Patients may more heavily value study conclusions and how these findings apply to their lifestyles, behavioral habits, and even their readiness to interface with healthcare.Comparing and contrasting studies through systematic reviews and meta-analyses can help readers digest a large buffet of publications to formulate conclusions that may guide clinical decisions and highlight targets for future research. Such literature reviews are not perfect because they can be subject to several biases and are inherently dependent on the original study\\'s data quality.Yet, an even bigger hindrance to the pooling of results and synthesis of actionable conclusions is heterogeneity-comparing apples with oranges.Some degree of heterogeneity is inevitable, with variations in methodology, clinical practice, and patient populations; however, when possible, standardization with core outcome sets (COSs) can be a readily modifiable source of heterogeneity.Developed with validated methods that aim to honor the diverse interests of multiple stakeholders, structured COSs can facilitate more efficient research, greater consistency in the collection of meaningful endpoints, and more effective quality assessments of both the literature and healthcare. Enhanced structure may be particularly important for conditions with variable presentation and management, such as ectopic pregnancy.Chong et al. (1) have highlighted the variance in the defining and reporting of outcomes for ectopic pregnancy research.This is compounded by the fact that there can be ambiguity in its clinical presentation and management.Classically, an ectopic pregnancy could be diagnosed by a positive b-human chorionic gonadotropin level and a transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) showing a round anechoic adnexal structure outlined by an echogenic ringthe \\'\\'bagel sign.\\'\\'What about the patient with vaginal spotting and an early positive home pregnancy test result who has been trying to conceive for nearly a year and now has a TVUS with not only no bagel sign but also no evidence of an intrauterine pregnancy (IUP)?A pregnancy of unknown location puts the patient at a crossroad in terms of management because the underlying diagnosis could be one of several things: an early normal intrauterine pregnancy (that could be interrupted by ectopic pregnancy treatment), a resolving miscarriage, or a small ectopic pregnancy that is yet to become visible (but could still cause life-threatening hemorrhage at any size); plateauing values over several days of serial b-human chorionic gonadotropin monitoring may lead a provider to presumptively treat a pregnancy as an ectopic pregnancy, even in the absence of definitive TVUS findings.The significant variation in the presentation of these ectopic pregnancy examples underscores some of the difficulties in treating and studying such abnormal pregnancies; nevertheless what is very clearly known is the potential for high morbidity and even mortality in ectopic pregnancy cases.Thus, Chong et al. (1) emphasized an aim of generating a core set of universal outcome measures that can be used regardless of the scenario in which the ectopic pregnancy is diagnosed.In an uncertain clinical scenario, COSs facilitate reflection on the effectiveness of treatment outcomes in a more structured way to better inform individualized, risk-minimizing patient care and future studies. Yet, the harmonization of COSs requires thoughtful optimizing because they are only as good as their ability to be implemented and the appropriateness of their measures.The study by Chong et al. (1) reflects some of these limitations.Their final COS excludes variables pertaining to the psychological and economic impact of ectopic pregnancy (domains 5 and 6) because these did not meet consensus, although individuals with lived experience assigned a higher value to these domains (a mean score of 7.5, compared with 6.7 and 5.5 among healthcare professionals and researchers, respectively) (1) .Additionally, although the study recruited stakeholders worldwide, there was suboptimal representation from African (1%) and South American (<1%) developing countries compared with that from developed European (58%) countries and no variables examining access to care (1) .Pregnancy is an intimate condition, and patients\\' lives, feelings, and circumstances outside of the doctor\\'s office or the trial setting may heavily influence their outcomes. These more qualitative variables provide important context.For instance, it is difficult to accurately compare treatment failures, resolution times, or adverse events without examining treatment availability and compliance.Consider a variety of patients who fail methotrexate treatment and represent with ectopic rupture requiring emergent surgery.One patient received therapy but missed a necessary second dose because of a prohibitive travel distance to the clinic and the inability to procure childcare.Another patient lived in a state with vaguely worded abortion laws and was subject to a critical delay in medication due to challenges in interpreting legislative exceptions.A third patient presented late to care because of significant healthcare anxiety and despite being a less-than-ideal candidate, opted for medical management hoping to avoid costly surgery.There are endless variations to these scenarios, demonstrating that differences in ectopic pregnancy treatment failure, resolution time, and complications may depend on the context in which treatment was provided, rather than purely reflecting on the treatment itself.Attention to such healthcare disparities is critical because racial/ethnic and economic minorities are disproportionately affected by ectopic pregnancy and are at greater risk for associated complications (2) .The important work by Chong et al. ( 1) is an excellent foundation upon which future efforts can be made to identify and reconcile the values of even more diverse stakeholders.However, to be effective, even a perfectly curated COS must overcome the challenge of implementation.The study by Chong et al. ( 1) is strengthened by the investigators\\' rigorously structured consensus methodology and careful attention to defining the final core outcomes to help reproducibility and optimize application; they also made efforts to diversify their steering committees and stakeholders to yield generalizable, meaningful outcomes.Their results are publicly available in the expanding Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials Initiative database.In certain fields, uptake of COSs has been very successful; for instance, a study using the clinical trials registry showed that uptake of the rheumatoid arthritis COS has increased over time, now with more than 80% of trials in this field reporting data on the full set (3).Yet, despite readily available COSs in a growing range of health areas, several studies have demonstrated that there is still wide variation in uptake, particularly for patientreported outcomes (4, 5) .One study surveyed trialists, revealing that few had ever received education about COSs or been involved in COS development; most of them cited a lack of awareness of existing COSs, preference for trialspecific outcomes, or concerns about executing COS measurement as barriers to their inclusion in trials (4) .A study of patient-reported outcomes highlighted the impracticality of some lengthy patient questionnaires and the limited scope of disease-specific variables as obstacles to uptake (5) .Perhaps by standardizing variables that can be readily collected within the usual clinical workflow, COS uptake can be made more practical to guide clinical decision making in real time and reduce the collection burden on trialists. Ultimately, whether studying any aspect of reproductive health or medicine, it is clear that COSs are an important part of modern healthcare and research; however, there is room for growth in the development, distribution, and implementation of COSs to maximize their use and benefits.

This multicentered, case-control study recruited 117 couples with idiopathic RPL (as defined by the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology [ESHRE] guidelines) and 84 fertile controls (couples with full-term live births in the year before enrollment with no previous pregnancy losses) (1) .Using an HPV screening-genotyping assay, they found that sperm HPV infections were detected in 20% of couples experiencing RPL compared with only 4% of the fertile controls (P< .001).This comparison demonstrated that sperm HPV infection was significantly correlated with RPL using several multivariate models.Perhaps even more clinically and practically significant was the secondary endpoint, wherein the subcategory of high-risk HPV infections were also associated with RPL (odds ratio, 4.91; 95% confidence interval: 1.4, 17.26; P¼ .01) (3) . The investigators acknowledge the inherent limitations of a case-control study and point out the difficulty in obtaining high levels of evidence, as prospective trials would face significant barriers.An additional consideration is the role of SDF in mediating the effects of HPV infection.Although there were no significant differences in SDF (assessed using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling) between the HPV positive and negative groups, the study was not adequately powered to explore this association (3).Moreover, SDF was not used as a covariate in the multivariable model, as SDF testing was not performed in the fertile control group.Without a clear causal link between HPV and RPL, it is too early to advocate for routine HPV testing of male partners of couples with idiopathic RPL.Further investigations of the relationship between SDF, HPV infection, and RPL are needed to determine whether HPV is a truly independent risk factor for RPL. Despite these limitations, the study results have a potentially important practical application with regard to HPV vaccination.The current US Food and Drug Administration-approved HPV 9-valent vaccine protects against 7 of the 9 high-risk strains implicated in RPL and is approved for boys and men aged 9 through 45 years (3, 4) .The vaccine is quite safe-the Vaccine Safety Datalink and Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System found no statistically significant predetermined adverse events occurring with over 838,991 doses administered (4).Although vaccination is not routinely recommended for men aged between 27 and 45 owing to a presumed high prevalence of previous exposure, promising evidence demonstrates that vaccinating already infected males is associated with clearance of sperm HPV infection, increased spontaneous pregnancy rates, and decreased miscarriage rates (4, 5) .Likewise, vaccinating HPV naïve men would prevent the high-risk strains of HPV from infecting their sperm, although the vaccine\\'s independent effect on fertility outcomes is unknown (3) .Moreover, further studies should assess the impact of HPV vaccination on subsequent fertility outcomes in men with and without previous HPV infection; the findings from Busnelli et al. ( 3) provide, at the very least, another reason to support the broader campaign to eliminate or treat high-risk HPV strains through vaccination.Furthermore, reproductive urologists are uniquely positioned to recommend HPV vaccination in young men presenting for fertility care, and we should be familiar with guideline recommendations and emerging research in this area.\\n\\n==================================================\\n\\nFile: Ascending-toward-a-30,000-foot-view-of-uterus-tran.grobid.tei.json\\nTitle: Ascending toward a 30,000 foot view of uterus transplant\\nAuthors: Rebecca [\\'K\\'] Chung, Elliott [\\'G\\'] Richards, Ruth [] Farrell, Rebecca [\\'L\\'] Flyckt\\nAbstract: \\nBody Text: Historically, patients with absolute uterine factor infertility (AUFI) have faced limited options and no true treatments for what has been described by patients with AUFI themselves as a life-defining illness (1) .As many as 1.5 million people, or 1 in 500 women, have AUFI.Common causes of AUFI include congenital uterine agenesis or the acquired absence of the uterus, which can be the result of an unplanned emergent (e.g., obstetric complications) or a planned (e.g., gynecologic malignancy) hysterectomy (2) .Although in vitro fertilization with a gestational carrier or adoption may be feasible for some, these options are unrealistic for many women with AUFI because of legal, cultural, and personal barriers to these family building approaches (1) . Uterus transplantation (UTx) is a restorative surgical treatment for AUFI that has, for the first time in history, provided the ability for these patients to become gestational mothers.Twenty years since the first human attempt, 8 years since the first live birth, and with >30 infants born, UTx is no longer theoretical (and many argue no longer experimental given that it has been performed outside of clinical trials) with an increasing number of published case series that detail overall favorable surgical, reproductive, and longer term outcomes (3) .Uterus transplantation involves the procurement of a uterus from either a living or deceased donor and then transplantation into a recipient.The recipient undergoes rigorous screening and preparation with a highly specialized, multidisciplinary team.Postoperatively, the patient receives immunosuppressive medications along with extensive postoperative monitoring through embryo implantation and pregnancy until the graft eventually is removed after 1-2 livebirths (2).The complexity of this reproductive undertaking is clear and the ultimate measure of success is data from well-designed clinical trials to understand not just the benefits of the procedure, but also its risks to donors, recipients, offspring, and families. Br€ annstr€ om et al. ( 4) are recognized leaders in the field of UTx, having reported their landmark clinical trial in 2012 and the first successful live birth published in 2015.Their success soon was replicated by teams in the United States, South America, Europe, and Asia.In this issue of Fertility and Sterility, Br€ annstr€ om et al. ( 4) provided important contributions to the UTx literature by describing complete long-term outcomes from their initial trial.As a summary of their data, 7 of 9 transplants had return of menses within 2 months, all 7 patients conceived at least once, and 6 had at least 1 live birth.Each patient in this study underwent R2 in vitro fertilization cycles before UTx to bank at least 10 (largely cleavage stage) embryos, and cumulatively, 46 embryo transfers were performed, most of which were of day 2 embryos.Of the pregnancies, there was appropriate fetal growth with low-normal uterine blood flow throughout gestation.Although the publication does contain some redundancy with their earlier reports, there are novel elements that should be highlighted.The new data that the investigators included in this study were the longitudinal measures of physical and mental health of the UTx triad (donor, recipient, and child) after delivery.The investigators reported a normal height-weight growth trajectory over the child\\'s first 2 years of life with the mean just below the 50th percentile.Additionally, using validated survey questionnaires, all donor and recipients had no significant changes in their mental and physical component summary scores, nor differences in their anxiety, depression, and relationship satisfaction scores before and 4 years after UTx. Although the investigators emphasize that their longterm data provide support for UTx as a safe and effective treatment, they are transparent about the neonatal and pregnancy complications observed during the trial.This kind of transparency and open sharing of all data, including adverse outcomes, is necessary for the field of UTx to advance.Respiratory distress syndrome related to prematurity affected the first 4 neonates in the trial.This triggered a modification in practice to delay planned delivery from 35 week to 37 weeks, which showed improvements in neonatal outcomes.None of the remaining 5 neonates born after this change had respiratory distress syndrome and only 1 required a short neonatal intensive care unit stay.Another unfavorable outcome highlighted was preeclampsia.This study demonstrated that 3 of the 9 pregnancies after UTx were complicated by preeclampsia requiring delivery earlier than planned.The investigators assert that this adverse outcome was a consequence of having a solitary kidney related to Mayer-Rokitansky-K€ uster-Hauser syndrome, which all 3 women with preeclampsia had.Uterus transplantation itself and the immunosuppressive medications transplant patients take also potentially may elevate their risk for pregnancy-induced hypertension.Even with these neonatal and pregnancy complications, the investigators were reassured by the normal growth trajectory observed in the children born from UTx. Nevertheless, the risk of poor neonatal and maternal outcomes can add to the psychologic toll for patients with AUFI undergoing UTx.Br€ annstr€ om et al. (4) are the first to explore this important concern by detailing in their study the recipients\\' mental and physical health before and 4 years after UTx.Although mental and physical health did not appear to be negatively impacted for recipients in general, 2 recipients had poor mental component summary scores at 4 years after UTx; these 2 had either a poor baseline or were childless with a concomitant poor physical component summary score.In addition, patients who also had higher anxiety and depression scores 4 years after UTx were those who had multiple pregnancy failures.This underscores an important subgroup of the UTx population that may be at increased risk for poorer mental health outcomes, and for whom additional support can be anticipated. Though this article addresses the most pressing need in the UTx literature at present (the need for long-term outcomes data) a significant limitation that the investigators acknowledged is the small number of subjects in their study.Despite this limitation, their report remains very valuable by adding to the mounting evidence that UTx is a safe and effective treatment for AUFI, and also by shining a light on areas of inquiry that merit deeper exploration.We applaud Br€ annstr€ om et al. (4) for their transparency in describing their successes and complications, an essential element in the evolution of this unique procedure. Despite the encouragement that articles such as this provide, the burden still rests with UTx programs to collaborate on their research efforts.Initially, UTx trials generated encouraging anecdotes.More recently, we are moving these anecdotes into data.The next step must be an ascension to the 30,000 foot view.It is only at this vantage point, where aggregated, multicenter data from UTx registries can be seen, interpreted, and understood clearly, that we will gain the clarity needed to fully inform our understanding of the procedure.In this way, we can move together to develop best practice, improve outcomes, and fully understand the long-term outcomes for recipients, donors, and children.\\n\\n==================================================\\n\\nFile: Assisted-reproductive-technology--considerations-f.grobid.tei.json\\nTitle: Assisted reproductive technology: considerations for the nonheterosexual population and single parents\\nAuthors: Nicholas [\\'Saleem\\'] Raja, Colin [\\'B\\'] Russell, Molly [\\'B\\'] Moravek\\nAbstract: This study aimed to discuss fertility concerns unique to the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, plus and single-parent-to-be populations and review special considerations regarding the evaluation and treatment of these patients relevant to the practicing reproductive medicine provider.The use of assisted reproductive technology has rapidly increased over the past 50 years.Given these trends, providers can expect a greater diversity of patients making use of these technologies.Both the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, plus community and single parents-to-be represent understudied and important populations who often require the use of assisted reproductive technology to build their families.The American Society for Reproductive Medicine advocates for equitable treatment of patients regardless of sexual orientation and partner status, and health care providers working in the fertility field should be comfortable and confident in assessing the needs of and providing care to these populations.(\\nBody Text: ince the birth of the first infant via in vitro fertilization (IVF) in 1978, the utilization of assisted reproductive technology (ART) has dramatically increased in the United States over the last several decades (1) (2) (3) (4) .In recent years, ART has been used in approximately 2% of live births in the United States (3, 5) .Along with increasing ART utilization, there is increasing diversity among the ART population.Although issues of cost and access to care within reproductive medicine remain prominent, providers can expect to see individuals from a range of racial, ethnic, socioeconomic, and educational backgrounds as well as more single and nonheterosexual patients.As these trends continue, it is important to understand both ART patterns and individual needs of these populations to provide appropriate and quality care.Herein, we discuss the evaluation and management of 2 ART subpopulations: single parents-to-be and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, plus (LGBTQþ) patients. While most children continue to live with 2 parents, the rate of singleparent households continues to increase in the United States (6, 7) .The American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) noted in 2016 that 17.2 million (23%) children lived with a single mother and 3 million (4%) lived with a single father (7) .While single parents bear an increased share of responsibility in child-rearing, available research indicates that single parents can and do provide safe and secure lives for their children.Several studies have found no differences in mental well-being and childhood adjustment between single-parent and dualparent families (8) (9) (10) (11) .When psychosocial issues do develop in children of single parents, they tend to arise from the same stressors that impact dual-parent families (8) .In 2021, the ASRM reaffirmed its stance that individuals should have access to fertility care irrespective of partner or marital status (7, 12) . Discussion of an individual\\'s goals is one of the most important steps in approaching any new patient.Single parents may establish care with the intent to preserve future fertility, whether because they wish to wait for the right partner or they do not currently desire children.In contrast, some patients intend to conceive immediately.An understanding of the patient\\'s or couple\\'s goals will determine subsequent counseling and management.Generally, all patients, single or partnered, should undergo a standard fertility evaluation.Per the ASRM, diagnostic testing should be performed for those with known infertility conditions, such as structural anomalies or disease, and may be warranted for those in need of donor sperm (13) .Providers should collect a detailed medical history and perform a standard physical examination.If a patient has never attempted conception in the past and is presenting for donor inseminations, then the pros and cons of performing fertility testing immediately vs.only if insemination attempts fail should be discussed, with risk factors for issues such as diminished ovarian reserve or tubal disease taken into account.Other considerations, including costs of testing, cost of donor insemination, and time to pregnancy, should also be discussed with the patient.Patients with a uterus and ovaries may undergo ovarian reserve testing, including measurement of early-follicular-phase antral follicle count, folliclestimulating hormone, and antim€ ullerian hormone, and consider a cavity and tubal evaluation via ultrasound and hysterosalpingography with hysteroscopy and saline infusion sonohysterography as needed.Patients with testicles should undergo a semen analysis with additional workup by a urologist reserved for standard indications if they plan to contribute sperm.Of note, all history, examination, clinical laboratory testing, and imaging should be tailored to the individual and/or couple\\'s goals and unique features (13) . For patients hoping to preserve future fertility, available options include oocyte cryopreservation, IVF with cryopreservation of embryos using donor gametes, or ovarian tissue cryopreservation (OTC).Oocyte freezing and embryo freezing remain the gold standard for fertility preservation because these methods are associated with the highest likelihood of future pregnancy (14, 15) .While OTC is no longer considered experimental, it remains an uncommon practice and may not be available at all centers (15) . Single patients hoping to conceive immediately will require the use of donor gametes.Patients have the option of using donor gametes from anonymous, also known as \\'\\'nonidentified,\\'\\' or known/directed donors.Nonidentified donors have already met eligibility requirements and undergone mandated Food and Drug Administration (FDA) testing (16, 17) .Patients should be counseled that even known donors are required to undergo screening before providing a sample, including a questionnaire, physical examination, and sexually transmitted disease testing within 7 days of sample donation (17) .Multiple subpopulations are considered ineligible for sperm donation, including men with a history of sex with another man in the last 5 years (16) (17) (18) .Nevertheless, these FDA-ineligible people may donate as a known/directed donor with patient informed consent.Legal agreements are necessary for known/directed donors; however, legal consultation is advisable for all donor gamete arrangements to safely ensure parental rights.Providers should ensure that patients are aware of the benefits and risks associated with each donation method, including cost, ability or inability to make future contact with the donor, and potential custody issues.Individuals who are unable or do not want to carry a pregnancy themselves will also require the use of a gestational carrier to have a biologically related child.There are very limited data regarding the use of gestational carriers by single individuals.Special considerations for gestational carrier relationships will be discussed later in the section on LGBTQþ patients. Fertility treatment cost remains a critical barrier to several patients and is a critical component of patient counseling.Currently, only 19 states mandate insurance coverage for the evaluation and management of fertility concerns (19) .Among these states, both the criteria to qualify for coverage and maximum coverage amounts are highly heterogeneous.According to the ASRM and several insurance companies, infertility is the failure to achieve a successful pregnancy after 6-12 months of heterosexual intercourse, depending on age (13) .This definition is particularly problematic for single and LGBTQþ patients because they are excluded from coverage a priori (19) .Careful counseling is required so that patients have an accurate understanding of the financial implications of their options. The LGBTQþ community represents an important and understudied part of the ART population because much of ART and associated research focuses on the fertility of heterosexual couples (12, (20) (21) (22) .While same-sex couples are more likely to adopt and foster children, there are an increasing number of LGBTQþ individuals seeking ART for genetically related children (23) .In 2016, there were 114,000 same-sex couples in the United States raising children, including 24% of female same-sex couples and 8% of male same-sex couples, with 68% of same-sex couples raising biologic children (24, 25) .Available data indicate that the development, adjustment, and mental health of children are not impacted by the gender identity or sexual orientation of parents (7, 9, 12) . Consideration of gender identity is equally important.We recognize that a spectrum of gender identities exists and hereon will use transgender-nonbinary (TGNB) as an umbrella term for these diverse communities.Although data regarding the reproductive health of LGBTQþ individuals are growing, studies focusing on the TGNB community remain particularly scarce.Until only recently, there was widespread belief that TGNB individuals do not want children (26) .In reality, nearly 50% of TGNB individuals are currently parents, and 1 study found that over half of transgender men surveyed expressed a desire to have children (24, 27) .Furthermore, no evidence exists that children of TGNB parents suffer unique harm as a result of their parents\\' gender identity (7, 12, 28) .It has been well documented that sexual minority populations face higher levels of stress from societal discrimination and institutional exclusion resulting in negative health outcomes (29) (30) (31) (32) (33) . Differences in biologic sex and gender warrant additional nuance to fertility counseling because a same-sex cisgender male couple will have unique needs compared with a transgender/cisgender male couple.These data highlight the need for increased understanding of the reproductive health of the LGBTQþ community.All reproductive health care providers should be comfortable in engaging with and counseling patients outside of the heterosexual-cisgender framework on options for achieving their family planning goals. A much larger proportion of LGBTQþ couples present for care without any infertility diagnosis.However, simply because of the gametes they possess, most same-sex couples will require fertility treatments to conceive a child that is biologically related to one of the intended parents (23) .Providers should begin by assessing the patient or couple\\'s goals of treatment as well as the planned biologic contribution of each individual.For TGNB patients, a detailed history of any genderaffirming hormone therapy or surgery should be included.Certain portions of the standard evaluation may be included or omitted depending on parental gametes as well as the role each parent intends to play.Individuals considering using their oocytes should be offered ovarian reserve testing and cavity evaluation if they intend to carry a pregnancy.Individuals providing sperm should undergo a semen analysis with additional workup as needed.Once a complete evaluation has been performed, patients and partners should be counseled about available options for fertility preservation or attempting pregnancy. Cisgender same-sex female (SSF) couples require donor sperm to conceive.Once a sperm donor is identified, couples have several options available to them, including therapeutic donor insemination (TDI) with or without ovarian stimulation, autologous IVF, and reciprocal or co-IVF.Home or intravaginal insemination is a cost-effective and less invasive method compared with intrauterine insemination, with successful conception in approximately 40% of intravaginal insemination (34, 35) .It is important to note, however, that home insemination using donor sperm is not legal in all states, and there may be implications of establishment of legal parenthood when insemination is not performed by a physician.The decision whether to pursue TDI vs. autologous IVF is complex and beyond the scope of this study.Multiple studies have investigated the efficacy of TDI and IVF in SSF couples.Given that SSF couples present for care because of the need for donor sperm rather than failure to conceive, it has been hypothesized that SSF couples may have higher clinical pregnancy (CP) rates or live birth rates (LBRs) using ART than heterosexual couples (36) .Studies have produced conflicting results, with some studies suggesting statistically higher odds of CP and LBR among SSF couples, others demonstrating lower CP rates among SSF couples, and some with no differences at all between SSF and heterosexual couples (36) (37) (38) (39) .In a large analysis of the National Survey of Family Growth, pregnancies reported by bisexual and lesbian women were more likely to end in a miscarriage and stillbirth, even after adjusting for demographic factors (40) .Given these conflicting data, medical decision-making should be driven by usual indications as well as patient preference. Reciprocal or co-IVF is a unique option available to cis-SSF couples, wherein one partner undergoes controlled ovarian hyperstimulation and oocyte retrieval followed by transfer of a fertilized embryo into the other\\'s uterus.Multiple studies have found co-IVF to be both safe and efficacious (41) (42) (43) .One study has compared reproductive outcomes between co-IVF cycles and autologous IVF cycles in SSF couples.In this study, co-IVF had a higher CP rate and LBR than autologous IVF, even after adjusting for age, body mass index, and number of mature oocytes (44) .Additionally, a separate study suggested that shared motherhood (i.e., genetic and gestational motherhood) can lessen emotional insecurities in cis-SSF households after co-IVF (45) .Although limited, these data are encouraging and support the practice of co-IVF for interested cis-SSF couples.Importantly, co-IVF is not considered oocyte donation because the oocytes are considered shared, just as sperm is considered shared between heterosexual couples (16) . Same-sex female couples may also opt to use donor embryos to build their family.Most commonly, this refers to the donation of \\'\\'extra\\'\\' genetically normal frozen embryos from another patient.The ASRM supports the practice of embryo donation and notes that this option may be less medically complex and more cost-effective than the process of using donor gametes (46) .Compared with gamete donation, embryo donation has generated increased controversy given the special status given to embryos.The ASRM strongly discourages the use of the term \\'\\'embryo adoption,\\'\\' noting that this \\'\\'reinforces a conceptualization of the embryo as a fully entitled legal being\\'\\' (46) .Embryo donation requires careful counseling although it remains an option for couples.Despite the various ART options for SSF couples, there are still several barriers that SSF couples face in the reproductive clinic setting because these ART options still primarily target heterosexual couples (47, 48) . Given obvious anatomic constraints, options for cisgender same-sex male couples are considerably more limited and, by necessity, involve both an oocyte donor and gestational carrier.Like sperm donors, oocyte donors are required to meet FDA eligibility criteria and undergo a similar screening process.Providers should discuss the benefits and risks of using an anonymous vs. directed oocyte donor with all couples.The term \\'\\'gestational carrier\\'\\' refers to an individual who births a genetically unrelated child for another individual or couple (49) .Traditional surrogacy, in which an individual uses their own oocyte to conceive and carry a pregnancy for separate intended parents, is not condoned by the ASRM. Gestational carriers remain relatively uncommon but represent a growing proportion of annual ART cycles. Gestational carrier cycles accounted for 1.9% of cycles between 1999 and 2013; however, this increased to 3.1% in 2019 according to the most recent data from the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology (49, 50) .Having a child with the aid of a gestational carrier is complex and can lead to stress for all parties involved.For this reason, the ASRM recommends psychosocial evaluation of both the gestational carrier and intended parents (51) .Significant controversy exists regarding the use of gestational carriers, and a detailed discussion of third-party reproduction ethics is beyond the scope of this study.Laws governing the legality and structure gestational carrier relationships as well as designation of parental rights vary significantly state by state.Health care providers should have a basic understanding of such laws in their state and recommend legal consultation to all couples in accordance with the ASRM recommendations (51) . It is estimated that approximately 1.4 million people in the United States identify as TGNB, approximately 0.6% of the US population (26, 52) .For TGNB patients, the gender affirmation process is a highly individualized experience that often carries significant physical and emotional changes.There are a wide range of gender-affirming therapies and procedures, including combinations of hormone blockers and supplementation, facial masculinizing and feminizing procedures, breast or \\'\\'top\\'\\' surgery, genital or \\'\\'bottom\\'\\' surgery, and body contouring procedures.For TGNB patients, a detailed history of any gender-affirming hormone therapy and surgery should be included in the standard fertility workup as well as if patients would even consider the use of their natal organs. Gender-affirming therapies may also have the potential to impact fertility (53) (54) (55) (56) (57) (58) (59) (60) .Prolonged exposure to testosterone in those assigned female at birth is thought to suppress ovulation and lead to amenorrhea as well as histologic changes within the ovary (26, 55, 56) .Likewise, prolonged exposure to estrogen in those assigned male at birth (AMAB) is associated with decreased testicular volume and spermatogenesis (26, 54, (57) (58) (59) (60) .One retrospective study of 69 sperm samples from transgender women on estrogen found significantly reduced semen parameters while on hormonal therapy, with improvement in parameters with discontinuation of hormones before cryopreservation (58) .Another study noted higher rates of oligospermia, teratospermia, and asthenospermia in transgender women who had not yet started genderaffirming hormonal therapy, with nearly 75% of the cohort possessing an abnormal sperm motility count (59) .The degree of gonadal change and the potential reversal of these changes are impossible to predict for a given individual (26) . The World Professional Association for Transgender Health, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and Endocrine Society recommend discussion of fertility and fertility preservation before transition (25, 53, 54, 61) .Research indicates that several TGNB individuals consider this an important topic.In a study of transgender men, 23% had or would have considered oocyte cryopreservation before transitioning, and 37% would have considered cryopreservation if the technology had been available (25, 27) .All AMAB individuals should be counseled on options for sperm cryopreservation, transepididymal sperm extraction, and testicular tissue preservation with referral to an andrologist as needed.Similarly, patients assigned female at birth should receive counseling on oocyte and embryo cryopreservation with either partner or donor sperm, as well as OTC.Gamete or tissue cryopreservation offers TGNB patients the ability to transition on their own time while preserving future fertility options without a partner (62) .From the limited data in the literature, there is mixed evidence as to whether transgender youth and adolescents who seek genderaffirming care are appropriately counseled on fertility preservation options, and subsequently, very few follow through with cryopreservation methods, likely due to significant financial barriers of most TGNB youth (63) (64) (65) (66) . There is a paucity of data on pregnancy and pregnancy outcomes among transgender men; however, current literature suggests promising results (67, 68) .In a series of 56 transgender men who experienced pregnancy after transitioning, 80% resumed menses within 6 months of stopping testosterone, and only 7% received fertility treatment to conceive (25, 69) .Additionally, there were no differences in obstetric outcomes between those who had and had not used testosterone before conception (69) .In a case series of 3 TGNB individuals who underwent oocyte cryopreservation before gender-affirming hormone therapy, 2 went on to have healthy live children using these preserved oocytes with pregnancies carried by their partners (70) .Typically, reproductive specialists recommend testosterone discontinuation for several months before oocyte retrieval, although a recent case report demonstrated successful ovarian stimulation and retrieval after 24 days of testosterone cessation (71, 72) .Testosterone does have known teratogenic effects and, thus, currently is not recommended while attempting conception or during pregnancy (73, 74) .To date, there have been no large studies on the health of offspring conceived from testosterone-exposed oocytes (67) .There is debate on the statistical risk of pregnancy for transgender men on testosterone therapy, given the purposed ovulation suppression from increased androgen levels (74, 75) .However, several case series have demonstrated pregnancies, whether intended or unintended, while taking testosterone (69, (76) (77) (78) (79) .Given these cases, it can be determined that testosterone is not an adequate contraceptive method if patients are having intercourse with pregnancy potential (73, 76) . It is important for health care providers to acknowledge and counsel patients on physical changes they may experience from discontinuing hormone therapy, undergoing fertility treatment, or experiencing pregnancy.Reversal of hormone-induced physical changes may cause significant dysphoric distress, and pelvic examinations involved in gynecologic care have been shown to induce feelings of gender dysphoria (63, 80, 81) .Several studies suggest that several providers lack the knowledge regarding fertility needs of the TGNB community, emphasizing the need for increased education on counseling and resources for these populations (63) .In a study of transgender men, half of participants delayed health care visits solely due to previous speculum pain (82) .Transgender women and other AMAB patients on estrogen may be unable to produce a sperm sample via masturbation (26, 83) .Providers should be prepared to set expectations with patients and offer emotional support, including referral to mental health professionals.Future studies are needed to understand fertility and pregnancy outcomes in individuals having received gender-affirming hormone therapy, and transgender men experiencing pregnancy may benefit from care at centers with experience caring for this population. With the increasing utilization of ART, fertility centers can expect to care for an increasingly diverse patient population.Both single patients and LGBTQþ individuals represent growing subpopulations of ART users, each with their own biologic, social, cultural, and financial considerations that have an impact on family planning.Understanding the unique needs of different groups of patients will allow reproductive medicine providers to best care for these individuals as well as highlight areas for future investigation.

Reduced pregnancy and live birth rates and an increased miscarriage rate were observed in women with endometriosis and adenomyosis.The effect was larger in women with adenomyosis than in those with endometriosis.Women with superficial peritoneal and ovarian endometriosis do not appear to be at considerably increased risk of major obstetric and neonatal complications, whereas women with severe endometriosis, whether operated or not, are at several-fold increased risk of placenta previa.Moreover, deep infiltrating endometriosis is a risk factor for spontaneous hemoperitoneum in pregnancy and is associated with surgical complications at cesarean section.Overall, women with adenomyosis are at increased risk of various adverse obstetric outcomes, including preeclampsia, preterm delivery, fetal malpresentation, postpartum hemorrhage, low birth weight, and small for gestational age. Most studies included in the considered systematic reviews are characterized by substantial qualitative and quantitative heterogeneity.This makes a reliable assessment of the available evidence difficult, and caution should be exercised when attempting to derive clinical indications. Nevertheless, women with deep infiltrating endometriosis and severe adenomyosis should be considered at high obstetric risk and can benefit from referral to tertiary care centers where they can be safely followed through pregnancy and delivery.Whether the same should apply also to pregnant women with minimal endometriosis and adenomyosis forms is currently uncertain. Emerging evidence suggests that some adverse reproductive and obstetric outcomes observed in women with endometriosis are, in fact, associated with coexisting adenomyosis.(\\nBody Text: A n impressive amount of data has recently accumulated on associations between endometriosis and adenomyosis and fertility and obstetric outcomes.Despite this wealth of evidence, the impact of these conditions on the reproductive trajectory of affected women remains imprecisely defined (1) (2) (3) .It is unclear whether different disease phenotypes have similar effects, a biologic gradient exists, or these commonly associated conditions act independently or additively.It is also uncertain whether the relationship between endometriosis or adenomyosis and various pregnancy outcomes is causal and whether the treatment of lesions improves the obstetric prognosis.The information on which preconceptional counseling is based appears partly imprecise, and there is no consensus on whether all pregnant women with endometriosis and adenomyosis should be referred to tertiary care centers and followed as high-risk obstetric patients. With the aim of attempting to systematize the available evidence, we performed a comprehensive narrative synthesis of the numerous overviews with meta-analysis published in the last 5 years on the association of endometriosis and adenomyosis with infertility and pregnancy outcome.Studies were also selected, although not on the basis of a systematic approach, to summarize the potential pathogenic mechanisms by which endometriosis and adenomyosis may exert an effect on the likelihood of conception and on pregnancy course. On January 2, 2023, we searched PubMed for English-language studies using the terms \\'\\'endometriosis AND pregnancy\\'\\' and \\'\\'adenomyosis AND pregnancy,\\'\\' applying the filters \\'\\'article type, systematic reviews\\'\\' and \\'\\'publication date, 5 years.\\'\\'Only systematic reviews with meta-analysis were included.Additional articles were identified by scrutinizing the references of the retrieved reviews and using the PubMed\\'s \\'\\'similar articles\\'\\' function for all selected records.A total of 18 systematic reviews on endometriosis and 5 on adenomyosis and reproductive and obstetric outcomes were finally included in this narrative synthesis.For each of the outcomes assessed, the number of selected studies, overall number of cases and controls, and effect sizes, expressed as odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI), were extracted from individual reviews.Outcomes were considered if at least 2 studies were available that allowed data to be pooled.When the 95% CI did not include unity, the strength of the association between endometriosis or adenomyosis and the considered outcome was defined as weak if the pooled OR was >1 to 1.5 or <1 to 0.67, moderate if it was >1.5 to 3 or <0.67 to 0.33, and strong if it was >3 or <0. 33 . Institutional review board approval was not required for this review because only published and deidentified data were extracted from the selected original articles. Endometriosis and adenomyosis share a similar histologic feature, that is, the presence of endometrial glands and stroma in abnormal locations.However, they may affect fertility and pregnancy course through different mechanisms (Fig. 1 ).As expected, investigating the pathogenesis of a potential interference of these 2 conditions with fertility is complicated by their frequent co-occurrence as well as coexistence with other lesions, such as fibroids, that may influence reproductive events (4) . Pelvic adhesions, documented in most patients with deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) (5) , may disrupt pelvic anatomy, interfere with oocyte release, or impede oocyte uptake or transport by the fallopian tubes (6) .Moreover, chronic pelvic inflammation may result in a local milieu unfavorable to conception.Cytokines, growth factors, prostaglandins, and reactive oxygen species, found at high levels in the peritoneal fluid and lesions of patients with endometriosis, can interfere with ovulation, oocyte uptake, sperm function, gamete fertilization, and embryo migration.Peritoneal macrophages, which are increased in number and exhibit a dysfunctional phenotype in women with endometriosis, are central to these phenomena (7) .Their increased ability to produce proinflammatory mediators perpetuates pelvic inflammation and promotes the recruitment of other immune cells (8) . Assisted reproductive technology (ART) could overcome some of these adverse phenomena; however, women with endometriosis may still face challenges during ART cycles, owing to an increased likelihood of unexpected poor ovarian response and a lower number of retrieved oocytes (9) .The pathophysiology underpinning ovarian damage, especially when an endometrioma is present, has been well described (10) .The replacement of normal ovarian cortical tissue with fibrous tissue in which the cortex-specific stroma is reduced is likely caused by reactive oxygen species permeating the tissues surrounding the cyst and the proteolytic substances degrading the adjacent areas.Fibrosis is followed by follicular loss and intraovarian vascular injury. In addition, several molecular aberrations observed in the eutopic endometrium of women with endometriosis may cause defects in endometrial receptivity possibly hampering embryo implantation (11) .However, contradictory results were reported when strictly controlling for ovarian and embryonic parameters (12, 13) . In women with adenomyosis, infertility may arise mostly because of local endometrial inflammation, at least when lesions infiltrate the inner myometrium.The establishment of an adenomyotic focus would lead to platelet aggregation and hypoxia, resulting in the production of inflammatory cytokines and prostaglandins, as well as an increase in local estrogens synthesis (14) .These events may prompt both uterine hyperperistalsis through estrogen receptor induction of oxytocin signaling and fibrosis through epithelialmesenchymal transition and fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transdifferentiation.Although abnormal contraction waves are thought to disrupt gamete and embryo transport, local inflammation and fibrosis are considered determinants of an altered uterine milieu unfavorable for embryo implantation.Notably, the number of microvilli is reduced, steroid hormone metabolism is altered, and the oxidative stress is increased in the endometrium of affected women (15) .Because adenomyosis has not been associated with adverse effects on folliculogenesis, ART is here unlikely to overcome this type of reproductive barrier. The observation that perturbations during the periimplantation period can persist throughout the entire pregnancy course is crucial for the understanding of the embryo-maternal dialog.In fact, the complex and tightly regulated dynamics of pregnancy make it susceptible to perturbations if the timing of early events goes awry (16) .Delayed implantation beyond the window of receptivity is thought to lead to embryo misplacement, resulting in placenta previa and/or accreta, or placental insufficiency leading to intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and/or preeclampsia.Premature decidual senescence can lead to preterm birth and fetal demise, whereas shallow trophoblast invasion into the maternal decidua and/or blood vessels can lead to preeclampsia (17) . Adenomyosis may potentially increase the risk of adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes, such as preeclampsia, preterm birth, and small-for-gestational-age (SGA) newborns (18) through different pathogenic mechanisms including the following: disruption of the uterine junctional zone (JZ) and, thus, of uterine peristalsis during the luteal phase (abnormal uterine contractility is associated with failure to progress, uterine hyperstimulation and atony, placental retention, and postpartum hemorrhage) (19) (20) (21) ; increased intrauterine oxidative stress that may lead to maternal endothelial dysfunction underlying abnormal placentation (15, 22) (the spiral arteries may undergo hyperplastic changes, resulting in increased flow impedance of the uterine arteries and placentation defect); and increased inflammatory environment that may alter myometrial decidualization, determining an abnormal trophoblastic JZ invasion during pregnancy (23) . How endometriosis could negatively affect pregnancy course is more difficult to hypothesize.In advanced endometriosis forms, a fibrotic entrapment of pelvic vessels may determine an increase in arterial wall stiffness with secondary decrease in vascular compliance, thus hampering the physiological hemodynamic adaptation that occurs during pregnancy (23) .Moreover, the numerous endometrial molecular abnormalities (11) and increased JZ thickness observed in affected patients may be involved in placental dysfunction or abnormal placental implantation (24, 25) .Whether and to what extent the inflammatory pelvic environment of women with endometriosis may directly or indirectly increase the risk of specific adverse obstetric outcomes is currently undefined. The summary results of the selected meta-analyses on the association between endometriosis or adenomyosis and reproductive and pregnancy outcomes are shown in Tables 1 2 3 4 . On the basis of the results of 29 studies, Horton et al. (18) reported a 15% reduction in the likelihood of conception after in vitro fertilization (IVF)/intracytoplasmic sperm injection in women with endometriosis compared with that in women without the condition.However, the effect was no longer significant in selected subgroup analyses (stages I-II and III-IV separately, patients with ovarian endometriomas vs. controls).Data on women with DIE were too heterogeneous to be combined in a meta-analysis (Table 1 ). The same investigators observed a slightly increased risk of miscarriage when women were stratified according to disease stage (stages I-II and II-IV vs. controls) but not when they were categorized according to the presence of ovarian endometriomas.Huang et al. (26) observed a higher risk of miscarriage only in patients who conceived spontaneously but not in those who conceived after ART.In contrast to the findings of Horton et al. (18) , the effect was no longer statistically significant in a subgroup analysis on the basis of disease stage categorization (either stage I-II or II-IV vs. controls).In the meta-analysis by Wang et al. (27) , miscarriage risk was slightly increased in all women with endometriosis and in those who conceived solely after ART. A 12% reduction in live birth rate (LBR) after ART was observed by Horton et al. (18) only in patients with stage III-IV endometriosis, whereas Qu et al. (28) reported no difference compared with controls. In the meta-analysis by Horton et al. (18) and Nirgianakis et al. (29) , a reduction of 31%-43% in the likelihood of conception was observed in patients with infertility with the disease (Table 2 ). The miscarriage rate consistently increased in 3 metaanalyses with ORs ranging from 2.17 (29) to 3.49. A 55% reduction in LBR after ART was reported by Horton et al. (18) , whereas Nirgianakis et al. (29) did not find a difference between cases and controls. Overall, no increase in the risk of ectopic pregnancy, gestational diabetes, low birth weight, and operative vaginal delivery was observed in women with endometriosis in the considered meta-analyses (26, 28, 30-35) (Table 3 ). A small increase in the risk of gestational hypertension was reported in 3 meta-analyses (18, 27, 33) , with pooled ORs ranging from 1.14 and 1.30.Similarly, the risk of preeclampsia either did not significantly increase (26, 28, 36) or only marginally increased (18, 27, 32, 33) , with pooled ORs below 1.20.Fittingly, the risk of IUGR also did not increased in women with endometriosis (26, 31) . The strength of the association between endometriosis and preterm delivery appeared weak in 4 meta-analyses (18, 31, 33, 37) and moderate in 3 but with pooled OR marginally above 1.5 (26, 27, 32) .At subgroup analysis, the risk appeared markedly increased only when considering pregnancies after natural conception (27, 31, 32, 38) . The risk of preterm premature rupture of membranes more than doubled in the single meta-analysis addressing this specific complication (32) .The risk of placental abruption significantly increased in only 2 of the 6 meta-analyses evaluating this outcome, with pooled ORs of 1.87 (18) and 1.40 (33) , respectively.The risk of antepartum hemorrhage also moderately increased (26, 32) . Women with endometriosis were more likely to deliver abdominally than controls, the risk being slightly increased in 2 meta-analyses (27, 33) and moderately increased in 3 (18, 32, 34) .The risk of postpartum hemorrhage marginally increased in 2 meta-analyses (28, 34) , moderately increased in 1 (26) and unvaried in 3 (32, 33, 39) . Inconsistent findings were reported also regarding the risk of SGA because 3 research groups observed a slight increase in the risk (31, 32, 37) and 2 reported no effect (28, 33) . The risk of stillbirth slightly increased (18, 26, 32, 33) , and that of neonatal death moderately increased (32) ; however, estimates were based on few events.The likelihood of neonatal intensive care unit admission marginally increased in 2 meta-analyses (18, 32) , and that of the 5-minute Apgar score of <7 was unvaried in 1 meta-analysis (32) . The risk of placenta previa stood out consistently and robustly among all 11 selected meta-analyses (18, 24, 26-28, 32, 33, 39-42) , with pooled ORs ranging from 2.09 in the entire study population of women with endometriosis (26) to 11.86 in the subgroup with severe lesions (40) .Accordingly, the risk of placenta accreta spectrum disorder was also over threefold times higher in women with endometriosis than in controls (24) .A separate section in the following is dedicated to this issue. Finally, women with severe endometriosis had an increased risk of spontaneous hemoperitoneum in pregnancy (SHiP).Previous systematic reviews not included in our search period identified DIE in the posterior compartment and IVF as the main risk factors, with an overall frequency of 0.4% in this patient population (18, 43, 44) .Although rare, SHiP is an extremely serious event that can endanger the life of both mother and fetus, with mortality rates of nearly 2% and 27%, respectively (44) . Meta-analyses by Horton et al. (18) , Nirgianakis et al. (29) , and Razavi et al. (45) consistently showed a greatly increased risk of preeclampsia in women with adenomyosis, with ORs ranging from 4.35 to 7.87 (Table 4 ). Women with adenomyosis also had a more than doubled risk of preterm delivery (pooled OR, 2.65-3.09) (18, 29, 37, 45) .At sensitivity analyses, the results were confirmed in the subgroups of women who conceived either naturally or after ART (29) .However, on the basis of a limited number of events, the risk of severe preterm birth did not significantly increase (29) . In 2 studies, a consistently increased risk of fetal malpresentation was observed in women with adenomyosis compared with that in controls (29, 45) , although the reported incidence of fetal malpresentation among cases was unusually high. Moreover, women with adenomyosis were at almost threefold risk of postpartum hemorrhage (29) . According to the findings of Nirgianakis et al. (29) , the risk of delivering an infant weighing <2,500 g was higher in women with adenomyosis, and a substantial increase in the risk of SGA was consistently reported in 4 meta-analyses, with pooled ORs ranging from 2.86 to 3.90 (18, 29, 37, 45) . Nirgianakis et al. (29) did not demonstrate a significantly increased risk of intrauterine fetal death in women with adenomyosis.No differences were detected also in the likelihood of the 5-minute Apgar score of <7 and rate of pH of <7.1 between neonates of mothers with adenomyosis and those of mothers without the condition (29).According to the results of the meta-analysis by Gasparri et al. (42) , endometriosis would be an independent risk factor for placenta previa, in addition to the risk already conferred by IVF per se.Indeed, the risk of placenta previa in women undergoing IVF was 3 times higher when infertility was 24), women who conceived after frozen embryo transfer were less likely to develop placenta previa than those who conceived with fresh embryos (OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.57-0.88).In addition, women with endometriosis had an increased risk of placenta accreta (adjusted OR, 3.39; 95% CI, 1.96-5.87) (24) .This is expected because the trophoblast can more easily infiltrate the myometrium when the placenta is implanted in the lower uterine segment compared with that in proximal sites. Notably, the independent effect of DIE on the risk of placenta previa was originally observed in a large series of women with defined lesion subtypes who conceived naturally (46) . Considering the strong association between DIE and placenta previa, a pathogenic role of these infiltrating forms of endometriosis seems plausible.Whether the cause of abnormal placental localization is endometriosis per se or the frequently coexisting adenomyosis (47, 48) is currently unknown, although the latter hypothesis is suggested by the results of a recent multicenter Italian study conducted in 11 centers of expertise including women with accurately defined endometriosis and adenomyosis subtypes who conceived naturally (3) .The risk of placenta previa significantly increased in participants with endometriosis and coexistent severe adenomyosis compared with that in participants with endometriosis and mild or absent adenomyosis (adjusted OR, 16.68; 95% CI, 3.48-79.71). Regardless of the mechanisms involved, a causal relationship appears to be supported also by the fulfillment of 6 of the 9 Bradford Hill criteria, that is, strength, consistency, specificity, temporality, biologic gradient, and plausibility (49) .Overall, on the basis of the World Cancer Research Fund\\'s 5 levels of evidence (convincing, strong evidence; probable, strong evidence; limited, suggestive evidence; limited, no conclusion; and substantial effect on risk unlikely, strong evidence) (https://www.wcrf.org/diet-activity-and-cancer/global-cancer-update-programme/judging-the-evidence/; accessed on January 16, 2023), the hypothesis of a causal relationship between DIE and placenta previa could be defined as \\'\\'probable-strong evidence.\\'\\'Does Surgery for DIE Reduce Obstetric Risks and Increase the Likelihood of Conception? If the hypothesis of a causal relationship between DIE and placenta previa is considered likely, the consequential question is whether excision of lesions reduces the risk.This could be considered reasonable only if endometriosis, and not coexisting adenomyosis, is the pathogenic mechanism leading to abnormal placental implantation.Unfortunately, few studies and a single systematic review have addressed this specific and clinically challenging research question. Mooney et al. ( 50) identified only 3 studies on the effect of prepregnancy surgical treatment of endometriosis on future obstetric outcomes.However, a quantitative synthesis of the data could not be originated because of heterogeneity in design, definition of study groups and outcome measures, and critical risk of bias.In a national cohort study on the basis of the Danish Health Register, the rate of placenta previa increased in women who underwent surgery for severe endometriosis compared with that in women who conceived in the nonsurgical group (OR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.66-2.52).In the same study, the increased risks of gestational hypertension, preterm birth, SGA, perineal laceration (OR, 6.06; 95% CI, 5.08-7.23),and both antepartum and postpartum hemorrhages were also reported after preconceptional excision of endometriosis (51) .The risk of placenta previa did not decrease in a case-control study comparing pregnancy outcomes in 49 women who underwent surgery for endometriosis and 31 women with nonsurgically treated lesions (OR, 2.83; 95% CI, 0.56-12.31) (52) .The third study included in the systematic review did not report the risk of placenta previa (53) . Nirgianakis et al. (54) reported the results of a casecontrol study on 62 women with endometriosis who conceived after excision of posterior DIE and 186 women without endometriosis.The frequency of placenta previa was significantly higher in cases (6.5%) than in controls (no event).The same was true for gestational hypertension and IUGR. The scanty evidence available does not support the hypothesis that women who underwent surgery for severe endometriosis have an improved obstetric prognosis compared with women who become pregnant with endometriotic lesions in situ.It cannot be excluded that other unrecognized or untreated factors, such as adenomyosis, may play a role.Therefore, until adequately designed and conducted trials demonstrate a benefit of preconceptional surgery, excision of DIE lesions may not be indicated with the sole aim of reducing the risk of maternal and neonatal adverse events. Defining an appropriate therapeutic balance between the potential benefits and potential harms of surgery for DIE when specifically aimed at improving reproductive and obstetric outcomes seems particularly relevant.Indeed, this is not only a matter of CIs and P values but also that of what level of risk of major complications each individual patient is willing to accept for which effect size.Different patients may have different priorities, and especially in these clinical conditions, women should be empowered to choose the treatment option that is more aligned with their personal preferences without being unduly influenced. Infertility associated with DIE in general, and with colorectal endometriosis in particular, constitutes an illustrative example.According to the results of the meta-analysis by Casals et al. (55) , the LBR was significantly higher in women with infertility who underwent DIE excision before IVF than in those who underwent IVF without prior surgery (OR, 2.22; 95% CI, 1. 42-3.46) .Only 3 trials were available for analysis, none of which was a randomized controlled trial.A specific benefit of surgery for colorectal endometriosis was reported in 1 study only (OR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1. 13-5.22) .Two of the studies were at high risk of bias, and the fixed-effects model was used for data pooling.On the basis of the results of a previous systematic review (56) , the natural pregnancy rate in women with infertility with in situ colorectal endometriosis was 26.5%, and that after colorectal surgery was 31.4%. In the meta-analysis by Bendifallah et al. (57) , the mean combined postoperative complication rates of discoid excision and segmental resection for bowel endometriosis (rectovaginal fistula, anastomotic leakage or stenosis, and voiding dysfunction) were 9.7% and 9.9%, respectively. Thus, in women with infertility with DIE and colorectal endometriosis, the benefit of radical lesion resection, although statistically significant, seems limited when considering either natural conception or pregnancy after IVF.This could be expected if adenomyosis, which remains unaffected by excisional endometriosis treatment, plays a role in determining infertility (58, 59) .In this regard, Martire et al. (60) analyzed the postoperative transvaginal ultrasound findings in 50 women who underwent segmental rectosigmoid resection for deep endometriosis and observed adenomyosis in 80% of them. Moreover, the generalizability of the aforementioned estimates is uncertain because the pooled postoperative pregnancy and complication rates were derived from studies conducted at centers of excellence where surgeons with unusually high technical skill are available.In addition, publication bias cannot be ruled out because surgeons with unfavorable results may be scarcely willing to submit their reports to medical journals and editors may be little motivated to publish poor results.absence of a formal randomized controlled trial, it seems difficult to distinguish the specific effect of excision of deep and colorectal lesions from that of superficial and ovarian lesions.Finally, Maignien et al. (61) reported a cumulative LBR of 64.4% in 101 women with bowel endometriosis who underwent direct ART without prior surgery. Surgery in women with severe pain symptoms in addition to infertility or at high risk of major gynecologic complications during pregnancy, such as bowel obstruction and ureteral stenosis, is an entirely different issue that should be carefully considered in tertiary care referral centers (62) (63) (64) . Finally, gynecologists should be aware, and patients should be informed, that severe DIE, whether operated on before conception or not, is associated with a substantially increased risk of major complications at both vaginal delivery and cesarean section (53) (54) (55) (56) (57) (58) (59) (60) (61) (62) (63) (64) (65) . For several reasons, the impact of adenomyosis and endometriosis on reproduction and pregnancy can only be roughly assessed.Most of the studies included in the selected metaanalyses are retrospective.The diagnostic criteria used are heterogeneous and sometimes not well defined, especially for adenomyosis, because some studies used transvaginal ultrasound, some magnetic resonance imaging, and others both.Most studies did not distinguish between the subtypes of endometriosis and adenomyosis (18) .Therefore, it is difficult to determine the specific impact of different disease forms.Some studies have included patients with both endometriosis and adenomyosis, making it difficult to accurately assess the impact of each condition separately. No less important, even when participants were formally included with either endometriosis or adenomyosis, unrecognized coexistence of the 2 conditions cannot be ruled out.Indeed, the oldest studies on the obstetric impact of endometriosis were conducted when awareness of adenomyosis was limited compared with that in recent years and when the image quality of ultrasound equipment allowing reliable identification of mild adenomyosis forms was not as defined as that of today.Moreover, underdiagnosis by unskilled operators cannot be excluded in some studies.This may have caused inclusion of several women with endometriosis or adenomyosis in the control group, thus potentially diminishing the actual magnitude of the effect of the 2 conditions on fertility and pregnancy outcomes. Only a minority of studies have separately investigated women with endometriosis in situ and those who have undergone lesion excision.As a result, it is difficult to understand whether, and to what extent, treatment before conception mitigates the adverse effects of the disease on selected obstetric outcomes. Adjustment for potential confounders was limited.For some outcomes, meta-analyses were based on few women and events; therefore, a type II error cannot be excluded even after combining data.Some CIs were wide, making it difficult to define a reasonably precise risk estimate.Different statistical approaches were used, and the CI may include unity in the random-effects model but not in the fixed-effects model.It is not uncommon for different meta-analyses on the same outcomes to produce different results.In several studies, natural and ART conceptions were not analyzed separately.However, different rates of ART conception between cases and controls and between different studies may affect the reliability of the pooled estimate because ART, as a recognized risk factor for several of the obstetric outcomes considered, may act as a confounder (66) . In general, endometriosis and adenomyosis appear to have a negative impact on reproductive and obstetric outcomes, even in naturally conceived pregnancies.However, given all aforementioned considerations, it is uncertain what kind of clinical weight should be given to the different effects of endometriosis and adenomyosis when only weak associations are observed, and combined estimates are calculated on the basis of a limited number of studies and events.Nevertheless, some overall conclusions can be tentatively drawn. First, the effect of adenomyosis on the likelihood of conception and the risk of miscarriage after ART appears greater than that of endometriosis.A marginal reduction in the LBR was observed only in women with advanced stages of endometriosis.However, when undergoing donor egg embryo transfer ART, women with and without mild adenomyosis forms had similar LBRs (67, 68) . Second, a strong association between endometriosis and placenta previa has been consistently reported, especially in women with DIE.As expected, the association with placenta accreta also appears to be robust.Although rare, SHiP is another threatening condition apparently associated with DIE. Third, women with adenomyosis are at significantly increased risk of developing preeclampsia and delivering an SGA infant.Again, an association between these 2 outcomes is likely, biologically plausible, and consistent with the currently accepted mechanisms of poor placentation and endothelial inflammation. The association between DIE and placenta previa could be considered causal, and the same may be true for the association between adenomyosis and preeclampsia.The increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage in women with adenomyosis is reasonably explained by myometrial fibrosis with secondary impaired contractile function after delivery.Weak or moderate associations were observed between endometriosis and several other obstetric outcomes.In particular, the risk of preterm birth only slightly increased.This risk was higher in women with adenomyosis but appeared to be limited to the late preterm category. Women with severe DIE and severe adenomyosis should receive specific and detailed preconceptional counseling.In particular, women with severe DIE should easily understand the absolute risk of placenta previa (approximately 1 in 15-20 pregnancies) and SHiP (approximately 1 in 250-300 pregnancies) (69, 70) , the clinical manifestations that should prompt immediate medical evaluation, and the potential consequences of delayed care.Once pregnant, women with severe DIE and extensive adenomyosis should be considered at significantly increased obstetric risk and referred to tertiary care centers where they can be followed through delivery and postpartum. Whether the same should apply also to pregnant women with limited endometriosis and adenomyosis forms is currently uncertain, and data are needed to verify whether such a clinical approach would be clinically effective and cost-effective.Given the nature of the outcomes and limited increase in the risk of most of them, it cannot be excluded that vigilant but standard obstetric care may prove adequate. In conclusion, most of the studies included in the systematic reviews considered here are characterized by substantial qualitative and quantitative heterogeneity.This makes a reliable assessment of the available evidence difficult, and caution should be exercised when attempting to derive clinical indications that may affect the obstetric prognosis of pregnant women with endometriosis and adenomyosis.Furthermore, this was not a systematic review, the quality of the included meta-analyses was not assessed, and some of them reported inconsistent results.In addition, the literature search may have missed some relevant publications. Nevertheless, women with early-stage peritoneal and ovarian endometriosis do not appear to be at high risk of major obstetric and neonatal complications, whereas women with DIE, whether operated or not, have an approximately 5% chance of developing placenta previa and 0.4% chance of experiencing SHiP.In addition, women with severe DIE have an increased risk of surgical complications at cesarean section and an increased risk of trauma and laceration at vaginal delivery (53, 65) .These women should deliver in tertiary care centers where experienced obstetricians, skilled pelvic surgeons, expert anesthesiologists, and services such as a blood bank, interventional radiology, and adult and neonatal intensive care units are available (66) . Overall, women with severe adenomyosis are at increased risk of several adverse obstetric outcomes, including miscarriage, preeclampsia, preterm delivery, fetal malpresentation, postpartum hemorrhage, low birth weight, and SGA, and would likely benefit from referral to tertiary care obstetric centers early in pregnancy. Emerging evidence suggests that some adverse reproductive and obstetric outcomes observed in women with endometriosis are, in fact, associated with coexisting adenomyosis (71) .This appears to be particularly true for women with DIE lesions (58) .In most meta-analyses, the association with the same adverse obstetric outcome was stronger for adenomyosis than for endometriosis.Given the universal availability and good overall diagnostic accuracy of transvaginal ultrasonography (72) (73) (74) (75) , further investigation of the impact of adenomyosis is now possible.Evaluating whether the type and degree of adenomyosis are correlated with the magnitude of the effect on reproductive and obstetric outcomes would be of great clinical importance (76, 77) . Given that the impact of delayed diagnosis may become apparent during pregnancy, the availability of more robust data would also allow consideration of whether screening for endometriosis and adenomyosis before trying to conceive would be equitable.\\n\\n==================================================\\n\\nFile: Aue-aungkul_et_al-2021-Cochrane_Database_of_Systematic_Reviews.grobid.tei.json\\nTitle: Postoperative interventions for preventing bladder dysfunction after radical hysterectomy in women with early-stage cervical cancer\\nAuthors: Apiwat [] Aue-Aungkul, Chumnan [] Kietpeerakool, Siwanon [] Rattanakanokchai, Khadra [] Galaal, Teerayut [] Temtanakitpaisan, Chetta [] Ngamjarus, Pisake [] Lumbiganon\\nAbstract: Postoperative interventions for preventing bladder dysfunction a\\nBody Text: Bladder dysfunction is a common complication following radical hysterectomy, caused by the damage to pelvic autonomic nerves that innervate the muscles of the bladder, urethral sphincter, and pelvic floor fasciae.Bladder dysfunction increases the rates of urinary tract infection, hospital visits or admission, and patient dissatisfaction.In addition, bladder dysfunction can also negatively impact patient quality of life (QoL).Several postoperative interventions have been proposed to prevent bladder dysfunction following radical hysterectomy.To our knowledge, there has been no systematic review evaluating the e ectiveness and safety of these interventions for preventing bladder dysfunction following radical hysterectomy in women with cervical cancer. To evaluate the e ectiveness and safety of postoperative interventions for preventing bladder dysfunction following radical hysterectomy in women with early-stage cervical cancer (stage IA2 to IIA2). We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2020, Issue 4) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE via Ovid (1946 to April week 2, 2020), and Embase via Ovid (1980 Ovid ( to 2020, week 16, week 16 ).We also checked registers of clinical trials, grey literature, conference reports, and citation lists of included studies. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the e ectiveness and safety of any type of postoperative interventions for preventing bladder dysfunction following a radical hysterectomy in women with stage IA2 to IIA2 cervical cancer. Two review authors independently selected potentially relevant RCTs, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, compared results, and made judgments on the quality and certainty of the evidence.We resolved any disagreements through discussion or consultation with a third review author.Outcomes of interest consisted of spontaneous voiding recovery one week a er the operation, quality of life (QoL), adverse events, post-void residual urine volume one month a er the operation, urinary tract infection over the one month following the operation, and subjective urinary symptoms. None of the included studies reported rate of spontaneous voiding recovery one week a er surgery, time to a post-void residual volume of urine of 50 mL or less, or post-void residual urine volume at 6 and 12 months a er surgery, all of which are important outcomes for assessing postoperative bladder dysfunction. Limited evidence suggested that bethanechol may minimise the risk of bladder dysfunction a er radical hysterectomy by lowering postvoid residual urine volume.The certainty of this evidence, however, was very low.The e ectiveness of di erent types of postoperative urinary catheterisation (suprapubic and intermittent self-catheterisation) remain unproven. The issue Radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy (removal of the uterus (womb) with its surrounding tissues and lymph glands in the pelvis) is the treatment for early-stage cervical cancer (when cancer is still within the cervix and upper vagina, without spread into nearby tissues).Bladder dysfunction (problems with the way the bladder holds and releases urine) is a common problem following radical hysterectomy, caused by the damage to the nerves controlling urination. To assess the usefulness and safety of treatment to prevent bladder dysfunction following radical hysterectomy in women with early-stage cervical cancer.We searched the scientific databases for randomised controlled trials (studies in which people or groups of people are allocated by chance to two or more groups, treating them di erently) published to April 2020. We found four studies that met the inclusion criteria.One study compared a medication called bethanechol to placebo (a substance that has no therapeutic e ect, used as a control in testing drugs).Three studies compared suprapubic catheterisation (insertion of a flexible tube (catheter) into the bladder through a cut in the lower abdomen to drain urine) with intermittent self-catheterisation (insertion of a catheter via the urethra, into the bladder at intervals throughout the day). Bethanecol may reduce the chance of bladder dysfunction by lowering the volume of post-void residual urine, assessed at one month a er surgery.However, the certainty of this evidence is very low and further studies have the potential to better inform this outcome.*The risk in the intervention group (and its 95% confidence interval) is based on the assumed risk in the comparison group and the relative effect of the intervention (and its 95% CI).CI: confidence interval; MD: mean difference; RR: risk ratio GRADE Working Group grades of evidence High certainty: we are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect Moderate certainty: we are moderately confident in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different Low certainty: our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect Very low certainty: we have very little confidence in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect a The evidence was downgraded by two levels due to serious imprecision (small sample size and wide CI crossing the line of no e ect). b The evidence was downgraded by one level due to indirectness (reporting adverse events of unclear severity and unclear their association with the intervention).c The evidence was downgraded by one level due to unclear risk of selection bias.

Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer a ecting women worldwide, with an estimated 569,847 new cases and 311,365 cervical cancer-related deaths globally in 2018 (Bray 2018) .Cervical cancer is a major health problem among women in developing countries, with almost 70% of the global burden and 90% of cervical cancer-related deaths occurring in these regions (Ferlay 2015; Bray 2018) .The high burden of cervical cancer among less economically developed settings is secondary to the failure to provide e ective, large-scale screening programmes (Torre 2015; Bray 2018). Treatment of cervical cancer depends on the extent of the disease.Appendix 2 displays a 2018 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging system for cervical cancer (Bhatla 2019) , which was revised from the 2009 FIGO staging system (Appendix 3).Women with early-stage cervical cancer (FIGO stage IA2 to IIA2) can be treated with either radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy (removal of the uterus with its surrounding tissues and lymph glands in the pelvis) or pelvic chemoradiation (radiation therapy to lower abdomen being given at the same time as chemotherapy) (Landoni 1997) .In premenopausal women, radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy may be preferable to pelvic radiation in order to preserve ovarian function and vaginal elasticity, as well as prevent the long-term risks of pelvic radiation (Cull 1993; Viswanathan 2014) . The aim of radical hysterectomy is to remove the primary tumour with an adequate margin of normal tissue to ensure complete resection (Piver 1974; Querleu 2008; Verleye 2009) .Appendix 4 lists details of the three systems for the classification of radical hysterectomy (Piver-Rutledge-Smith, Gynecological Cancer Group of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer, and Querleu and Morrow).The stage of cervical cancer is the fundamental factor to be taken into consideration when considering radical hysterectomy.Women with early-stage cervical cancer are traditionally treated with Piver type III radical hysterectomy.However, a previous randomised controlled trial (RCT) demonstrated that women with early-stage cervical cancer who underwent Piver type II hysterectomy (also called modified radical hysterectomy) had comparable oncological outcomes to those who underwent type III hysterectomy (Landoni 2001) .Pelvic lymphadenectomy is performed to look for metastatic lesions in the pelvic lymph nodes.The survival of women with earlystage cervical cancer who undergo radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy is excellent.Estimated five-year survival rates range between 70% and 90% (Kim 2000; Suprasert 2010; Srisomboon 2011; Mahawerawat 2013) . One of the most distressing morbidities that can occur following radical hysterectomy is bladder dysfunction (problems with the way the bladder holds and releases urine) (Lin 1998; Plotti 2011; Laterza 2015) .The incidence of bladder dysfunction a er radical hysterectomy varies from 12% to 85% depending on the method used in evaluating bladder dysfunction and the duration of follow-up (Zullo 2003; Wit 2014) .In addition, the risk of bladder dysfunction depends on the extent of surgery.Women undergoing type II radical hysterectomy are at lower risk of postoperative bladder dysfunction than those who undergo type III radical hysterectomy (Landoni 2001; Raspagliesi 2006) .By magnifying anatomical structures in the pelvis, laparoscopic approaches may help reduce the denervation of pelvic nerves during radical hysterectomy.However, it has yet to be shown that these approaches have a significant e ect on the prevention of bladder dysfunction (Laterza 2015; Kietpeerakool 2019) .Minimally invasive radical hysterectomy, however, is associated with inferior survival to laparotomy radical hysterectomy in women with earlystage cervical cancer.Consequently, a minimally invasive radical hysterectomy is not recommended.Although there may be a selective group of women for whom minimally invasive radical hysterectomy remains safe, further studies are needed (Ramirez 2018; Cusimano 2019; Chen 2020). Causes of bladder dysfunction following radical hysterectomy are secondary to the damage of pelvic autonomic nerves that innervate the muscles of the bladder (detrusor muscle), urethral sphincter and pelvic floor fasciae (Zullo 2003; Sellers 2012) .Bladder dysfunction following radical hysterectomy includes various functional disorders of the lower urinary tract, such as urinary retention, voiding di iculty, urinary hesitancy, urinary tract infection, and urinary stress incontinence (Chen 2002) . Bladder dysfunction increases the rates of urinary tract infection, hospital visits or admission, patient dissatisfaction, and the need for intermittent self-catheterisation (Manchana 2010) .Bladder dysfunction can also negatively impact patient quality of life (QoL), which can lead to embarrassment or even social isolation (Zhou 2016). Previous studies have demonstrated that a malfunctioning bladder detrusor muscle is a major cause of bladder dysfunction following radical hysterectomy (Plotti 2011; Laterza 2015) .Contraction of the detrusor muscle of the urinary bladder is stimulated by parasympathetic nerve impulses mediated by the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (Sellers 2012).Pharmacological therapy for voiding disorders consists of drugs that improve detrusor muscle contraction and those that reduce urethral resistance, which may have a role in the prevention of postoperative bladder dysfunction. Bethanechol, a cholinergic agent, is a synthetic ester, and is structurally and pharmacologically related to acetylcholine.Bethanechol increases the tone of the detrusor muscle by Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system (Kemp 1997; Madeiro 2006) . Cisapride is a prokinetic agent.It is principally prescribed for treating gastro-oesophageal reflux in children.The mechanism of action of cisapride is to stimulate the release of acetylcholine, thus promoting detrusor muscle contractility.Hence, as a result of its parasympathomimetic e ect, cisapride may be e ective for treating bladder hypotonia a er surgery (Madeiro 2006) .Cisapride, however, has been restricted to a limited access programme in the USA and Europe because it is associated with serious side e ects, including cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heart rhythms) and death (Henney 2000) . Suprapubic catheterisation (SPC), an insertion of a catheter via postoperative suprapubic cystostomy, has been proposed to hasten the recovery of bladder function compared with an indwelling urethral catheter, by minimising the risks of a urinary tract infection and asymptomatic bacteriuria, which can impede bladder function activity returning to normal (Kidd 2015) . Bladder training is an important form of behaviour therapy that can be e ective in treating bladder dysfunction following radical hysterectomy (Goldfarb 1967)  To evaluate the e ectiveness and safety of postoperative interventions for preventing bladder dysfunction following radical hysterectomy in women with early-stage cervical cancer (FIGO stage IA2 to IIA2). Criteria for considering studies for this review We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Women We planned to include any trial that attempted to compare the following. • A pharmacological agent and placebo or standard care. • Rate of spontaneous voiding recovery at one week a er surgery.We defined spontaneous voiding recovery as a voluntary void that has 50 mL or less of urine remaining in the bladder, measured by clean intermittent catheterisation a er the woman feels as though her bladder is empty.• Quality of life (QoL), determined using a scale that has been validated in accordance with the norms reported in a peer-reviewed publication (i.e. the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-CX24 cervical cancer-specific QoL questionnaire (Greimel 2006) ). • Time a er surgery to a post-void residual urine volume of 50 mL or less (days).Post-void residual urine was defined as the amount of urine retained in the bladder a er a voluntary void, measured by clean intermittent catheterisation a er the participant feels as though bladder is empty.We planned to present a \\'Summary of findings\\' table reporting the following outcomes listed in order of priority. • Rate of spontaneous voiding recovery at one week a er surgery. • QoL. • Time a er surgery to a post-void residual urine volume of 50 mL or less (days).• Adverse events. • Post-void residual urine volume one month a er surgery. • Urinary tract infections in the first month a er surgery. • Subjective urinary symptoms. We included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs), irrespective of the language of publication, publication status or sample size. We searched the following electronic databases on 20 April 2020. We searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (who.int/ictrp/en/) and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify any ongoing trials.If we identified ongoing trials that had not been published, we planned to approach the principal investigators and major co-operative groups active in this area to ask for relevant data.We searched the following databases for grey literature: Open-Grey (opengrey.eu/)and Index to theses (proquest.com/products-services/pqdt_uk_ireland.html). We handsearched reports of conferences from the following sources. • Annual Meeting of the Society of Gynecologic Oncology. • Annual Meeting of the International Gynecologic Cancer Society. • Annual Meeting of the European Society of Medical Oncology. • Annual Meeting of the British Gynaecological Cancer Society. • Biennial Meeting of the Asian Society of Gynecologic Oncology. • Biennial Meeting of Asia and Oceania Federation of Obstetrics and Gynaecology. Oncology. We checked the citation lists of the included studies and key textbooks for potentially relevant references.We searched for papers in all languages and translated them, if necessary.We planned to include unpublished trials only if trial data and methodological descriptions were provided in written form or through direct contact with the trial authors. We downloaded all titles and abstracts retrieved via an electronic search of the Endnote reference management database.A er duplicates were removed, we transferred these data to Covidence (covidence.org).Two review authors (AA and CK) examined the remaining references independently.We excluded those studies which clearly did not meet the inclusion criteria, and we obtained full-text copies of potentially relevant references.Two review authors (AA and CK) independently assessed the eligibility of the retrieved reports or publications.We resolved any disagreement through discussion or, if required, we planned to consult a third review author (KG or PL).We identified and excluded duplicates and collated multiple reports of the same study so that each study, rather than each report, is the unit of interest in the review.We used the details obtained from the selection process in Covidence to complete a PRISMA flow diagram and \\'Characteristics of excluded studies\\' table (Liberati 2009) . Copyright © 2021 The Cochrane Collaboration.Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Two review authors (AA and CK) independently extracted study characteristics and outcome data from included studies using Covidence.We noted in the \\'Characteristics of included studies\\' table if outcome data were not reported in a usable way.We resolved disagreements by consensus or by involving a third review author (KG or TT).One review author (CK) checked study characteristics for accuracy against the trial report. For included studies, we extracted the following data. • Author, year of publication, and journal citation (including language).• Country. • Setting. • Inclusion and exclusion criteria. • Study methodology. • Study population and disease characteristics: • total number enrolled; • participant characteristics; • age; • co-morbidities; • other baseline characteristics; • percentage of participants with non-cervical cancer (only RCTs involving mixed gynaecologic malignancies); • FIGO stage of cervical cancer; • the histopathological subtype of cervical cancer; • tumour size (largest tumour diameter); • the radicality of surgery (Piver or Querleu-Morrow). • Intervention details: • schedule of bladder training; • suprapubic cystostomy technique; • acupuncture; • cholinergic agents (dose, duration). • placebo; • no intervention.• Risk of bias in the study (see below). • Duration of follow-up. • Outcomes: for each outcome, we extracted the outcome definition and unit of measurement (if relevant); for adjusted estimates, we recorded variables adjusted for in analyses. • Results: we extracted the number of participants allocated to each intervention group, the total number analysed for each outcome, and the missing participants.• Notes: funding for trial and notable conflicts of interest of trial authors. We assessed and reported on the methodological quality and risk of bias in included studies in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2019) , which recommends the explicit reporting of the following individual elements for RCTs. • Selection bias: random sequence generation and allocation concealment. • Performance bias: blinding of participants and personnel (treatment providers).• Detection bias: blinding of outcome assessment. • Attrition bias: incomplete outcome data. • Reporting bias: selective reporting of outcomes. • Other possible bias. We considered outcome data as complete if at least 80% of participants underwent follow-ups and were assessed for primary outcomes.Two review authors (AA and CK) independently applied the \\'Risk of bias\\' tool and resolved di erences by discussion or by appeal to a third review author (KG or PL).We judged each item as being at high, low or unclear risk of bias as set out in the criteria displayed in Appendix 8. We provided a quote from the study report or a statement, or both, as justification for our judgement for each item in the \\'Risk of bias\\' table.We summarised results in both a \\'Risk of bias\\' graph and a \\'Risk of bias\\' summary.When interpreting treatment e ects and meta-analyses, we took into account the risk of bias in the studies that contribute to that outcome.Where information on risk of bias relates to unpublished data or correspondence with trial authors, we planned to note this in the table. We used the following measures of the e ect of treatment. • For dichotomous outcomes (e.g.rate of spontaneous voiding recovery one week a er surgery, rate of urethral catheter removal, rate of urinary tract infections, number of participants with normal detrusor pressure at maximum flow, adverse events), we analysed data based on the number of events and the number of women assessed in the intervention and comparison groups.We used these to calculate the risk ratio and 95% confidence interval.• For continuous outcomes (e.g.duration of postoperative retained urethral catheterisation, post-void residual urine volume and QoL measures), we analysed data based on the means, standard deviations and number of women assessed for both the intervention and comparison groups to calculate the mean di erences between treatment arms with their 95% confidence intervals.If the mean di erence was reported without individual group data, we used this to report the study results.If more than one study measured the same outcome using di erent tools, we calculated the standardised mean di erence and 95% confidence interval using the inverse variance method.• For time-to-event data (e.g.time a er surgery to a post-void residual urine volume of 50 mL or less), we planned to extract the log of the hazard ratio (log HR ) and its standard error from trial reports.If these were not reported, we planned to estimate the log HR and its standard error using the methods of Parmar 1998. We included studies in which individual women were randomised. In a study with multiple intervention groups, we planned to combine all relevant experimental intervention groups into a single group to create a single pair-wise comparison, where possible (Higgins 2019) . Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. We planned to contact the original investigators to request missing data.If we could not contact the investigators or could not obtain the requested missing data, we planned to analyse only the available data and not to impute missing outcome data for any of the outcomes. We clinically assessed heterogeneity by visual inspection of forest plots.We assessed statistical heterogeneity in each meta-analysis using the I 2 statistic and Chi 2 test (Higgins 2003) .We regarded heterogeneity as substantial if the I 2 statistic value was greater than 50% or there was a low P value (< 0.10) in the Chi 2 test for heterogeneity (Deeks 2001; Higgins 2019) .If there was substantial statistical heterogeneity, we planned to carry out subgroup analyses to assess di erences among the included studies.However, if there was both clinical and methodological heterogeneity across included studies, we planned to not report pooled results from meta-analysis, but instead use a narrative approach to data synthesis. See Di erences between protocol and review. We were unable to assess reporting bias, as only four studies met our inclusion criteria. We applied the random-e ects model with inverse variance weighting for all meta-analyses (DeSimonian 1986).We performed statistical analysis using Review Manager 5.4 (Review Manager 2014). • For time-to-event data, we planned to pool hazard ratios using the generic inverse variance.• For any dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the risk ratios for each study and then pooled them.• For continuous outcomes, we pooled the mean di erences among the treatment arms, if all trials measure the outcome on the same scale; otherwise we planned to pool standardised mean di erences See Di erences between protocol and review. We intended to carry out subgroup analyses in order to assess the e ect of the following factors. • Tumour size (2 cm or less versus more than 2 cm). • Surgical approach (laparotomy versus minimally invasive surgery).• Nerve-sparing approach during a radical hysterectomy (yes versus no).We planned to assess subgroup di erences using the interaction tests available within Review Manager 2014.We planned to report the results of subgroup analyses by quoting the Chi 2 statistic and P value, the interaction test, and the I 2 statistic.However, we did not perform subgroup analysis, as most analyses were based on only one or two included studies.Nevertheless, we acknowledged these factors in the interpretation of review findings. See Di erences between protocol and review. We were unable to conduct any of the planned sensitivity analyses due to insu icient data.If more studies are included in a future update, we plan to perform sensitivity analyses in order to assess the e ect of the following factors. • Repeating the analysis excluding unpublished studies (if any). • Repeating the analysis excluding studies judged to be at \\'high\\' or \\'unclear\\' risk of bias for allocation concealment. We created Summary of findings tables to summarise the results of the meta-analyses conducted for each of the outcomes, as outlined in the section Types of outcome measures.We graded the overall certainty of the evidence for each outcome according to the GRADE approach, which takes into account issues related not only to internal validity (risk of bias, inconsistency, imprecision, publication bias) but also to external validity, such as directness of results (Langendam 2013) .We created a \\'Summary of findings\\' table based on the methods described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Schünemann 2011), and used GRADEpro GDT (Summary of findings 1; Summary of findings 2). • High certainty: the true e ect lies close to that of the estimate of the e ect.• Moderate certainty: the true e ect is likely to be close to the estimate of the e ect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially di erent.• Low certainty: the true e ect may be substantially di erent from the estimate of the e ect.• Very low certainty: the true e ect is likely to be substantially di erent from the estimate of e ect. We downgraded the evidence from \\'high\\' certainty by one level for each serious (or by two for each very serious) limitation. ) .Suprapubic catheterisation consisted of insertion of a Bonanno suprapubic catheter at the time of surgery, followed by free drainage, followed by catheter removal at five to seven days a er the surgery. None of the included studies reported rate of spontaneous voiding recovery at one week a er surgery, time to a post-void residual urine volume of 50 mL or less, post-void residual urine volume at 6 and 12 months a er surgery, and poor bladder compliance. Nwabineli 1993 reported time a er surgery to a post-void residual urine volume of less than 100 mL, adverse events, and rate of urinary tract infections in the first month a er surgery. Suprasert 2002 reported time a er surgery to a post-void residual urine volume of less than 75 mL, adverse events, and rate of urinary tract infections in the first month a er surgery. Naik 2005 reported QoL, time a er surgery to a post-void residual urine volume of less than 100 mL, adverse events, rate of urinary tract infections in the first month a er surgery, and subjective urinary symptoms. Madeiro 2006 reported post-void residual urine volume one month a er surgery, flow rate, maximum flow rate, number of women with low maximum flow rate, number of women with low detrusor pressure at maximum flow, and bladder compliance. See Characteristics of excluded studies, Characteristics of ongoing studies, and Characteristics of studies awaiting classification. We excluded seven reports because their participants were not the population that this review aimed to assess See Characteristics of included studies table, Figure 2 , and Figure 3 for full details.Madeiro 2006 stated that the participants were allocated using a computerised randomisation schedule.However, they did not state the concealment process.This trial therefore was at unclear risk of selection bias. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Naik 2005 stated that the participants were randomised by drawing a sealed envelope that developed from an independent administrator, but did not state the methods of random sequence generation.Consequently, this trial was judged as having an unclear risk of selection bias. Nwabineli 1993 stated that the participants were randomised using random sampling numbers.However, they did not state the allocation concealment process.This trial therefore was at unclear risk of selection bias. Madeiro 2006 stated that all medications were provided in packages of identical appearance.Identification was only made by a standardised code.Randomisation was only revealed at the end of the trial and was controlled by an independent investigator.This trial, therefore, was at low risk of performance and detection biases. Blinding of participants and personnel was not feasible in Nwabineli 1993, Suprasert 2002, and Naik 2005, which compared suprapubic catheterisation versus intermittent selfcatheterisation.However, the outcomes of interest (i.e.time a er surgery to a post-void residual urine volume less than 75 mL, adverse events, and rate of urinary tract infections in the first month a er surgery) were unlikely to be a ected by lack of blinding of participants and personnel.Hence, we considered these studies as having a low risk of bias for this domain. All included studies were at low risk of attrition bias as they had low percentages of withdrawals and dropouts (Nwabineli 1993; Suprasert 2002; Naik 2005; Madeiro 2006 ).See Characteristics of included studies for the proportion of participants analysed. None of the included studies reported the rate of spontaneous voiding recovery one week a er surgery, or post-void residual urine volume at 6 and 12 months a er surgery.Quality of life (QoL), adverse events and subjective urinary symptoms, which are important outcomes, were rarely reported.An adverse event was assessed only in Suprasert 2002.Naik 2005 reported QoL and subjective urinary symptoms but available data, however, were insu icient to calculate the relative measures of the e ect of interventions.Due to a lack of reported outcomes that are the elements necessary for decision-making, all included studies thus were at high risk of reporting bias (Higgins 2017) . There was no Information indicating other important risks of bias.Accordingly, all included studies were judged as having a low risk of bias for this domain. See: Summary of findings 1 Bethanechol compared to placebo for preventing bladder dysfunction a er radical hysterectomy in women with early-stage cervical cancer; Summary of findings 2 Suprapubic catheterisation compared to intermittent selfcatheterisation for preventing bladder dysfunction a er radical hysterectomy in women with early-stage cervical cancer None of the studies reported the rate of spontaneous voiding recovery one week a er surgery, time a er surgery to a postvoid residual urine volume of 50 mL or less, post-void residual urine volume at 6 and 12 months a er surgery, and poor bladder compliance.Consequently, we added time a er surgery to a postvoid residual urine volume of 75 mL or less, and 100 mL or less, respectively, and bladder compliance, as additional secondary outcomes (see Di erences between protocol and review). Madeiro 2006 reported four-arm comparisons including placebo; bethanechol alone given 10 mg orally every eight hours; cisapride alone given 10 mg orally every eight hours; and a combination of 10 mg of bethanechol and cisapride given orally every eight hours.As cisapride has been restricted in the USA and Europe due to its serious side e ects, including cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heart rhythms) and death, we, therefore, included only the data obtained from participants allocated to placebo and bethanechol alone in the analyses. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. No data were reported for this outcome. No data were reported for this outcome. Flow rate at one month a er surgery among participants receiving bethanechol was higher than that noted among participants allocated to placebo (MD 1.20, 95% CI 0.25 to 2.15; 39 participants; Analysis 1.2). The maximum flow rate at one month a er surgery among participants receiving bethanechol was higher compared to those who were assigned to the placebo group (MD 3.20, 95% CI 1.82 to 4.58; 39 participants; Analysis 1.3). Participants receiving bethanechol had a lower risk of having a low maximum flow rate than those given placebo (RR 0.36, 95% 0.18 to 0.72; 39 participants; Analysis 1.4). Detrusor pressure at maximum flow, assessed at one month a er surgery among participants receiving bethanechol was higher than that noted among participants receiving placebo (MD 8.4, 95% CI 4.92 to 11.88; 39 participants; Analysis 1.5). Participants receiving bethanechol had a lower risk of encountering low detrusor pressure at maximum flow than those given placebo (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.63; 39 participants; Analysis 1.6). See Di erences between protocol and review. The trial did not report poor bladder compliance but reported bladder compliance assessed at one month a er surgery.There was no di erence in bladder compliance evaluated at one month following surgery between the two comparison groups (MD 8.90, 95% CI -0.33 to 18.13; 39 participants; Analysis 1.7). Four reports of Nwabineli 1993, Suprasert 2002, and Naik 2005 compared SPC versus ISC. None of the studies reported the rate of spontaneous voiding recovery one week a er surgery. Naik 2005 and their update report assessed QoL among 36 participants at 3 weeks, 6 weeks and 12 weeks a er surgery, using EORTC QLQ C30 questionnaires.The trial found no significant di erences between the two groups.Nevertheless, data were insu icient for calculating MD of QoL scores among the comparison groups. None of the studies reported this outcome.See Di erences between protocol and review.Suprasert 2002, assessing 71 participants, found that women given SPC went a longer time to a post-void residual urine volume of 75 mL or less than women given ISC (MD 4.2 days, 95% CI 1.17 to 7.23; Analysis 2.1). See Di erences between protocol and review. Nwabineli 1993 and Naik 2005 reported time a er surgery to a post-void residual urine volume of 100 mL or less.A meta-analysis assessing 64 women showed that women given SPC went a shorter time a er surgery to a post-void residual urine volume of 100 mL or less than women given ISC (MD -11.02 days, 95% CI -17.78 to -4.26; two studies, very low certainty evidence; Analysis 2.2).The percentage of variability in e ect estimates due to heterogeneity rather than to chance was not important (I 2 = 0%). Suprasert 2002, assessing 71 participants, reported acute complications a er surgery.The trial showed no di erence in risk of acute complications a er surgery (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.24 to 2.49; very low certainty evidence; Analysis 2.3) between participants who underwent SPC (four events in 33 participants) and those who underwent ISC (six events in 38 participants). None of the studies reported this outcome. In Nwabineli 1993, 7 of 10 participants assigned to the SPC group and 13 of 14 participants assigned to the ISC group experienced urinary tract infection.In Suprasert 2002, 8 of 33 participants and 11 of 38 participants assigned to the SPC and ISC groups, respectively, experienced urinary tract infection. A meta-analysis of Nwabineli 1993 and Suprasert 2002, assessing 95 participants, showed no di erence in risk of the rate of urinary tract infections during the first month a er surgery (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.13; very low certainty evidence; Analysis 2.4).The percentage of variability in e ect estimates due to heterogeneity rather than to chance was not important (I 2 = 0%). Naik 2005 and their update publication reported subjective urinary symptoms using a urinary symptoms questionnaire (USQ).This trial found no di erences in terms of subjective urinary symptoms between participants undergoing suprapubic catheterisation and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews those who underwent intermittent self-catheterisation. Available data, however, were insu icient to calculate the relative measures of the e ect of interventions.We were unable to obtain additional data by contacting the authors of the trial. None of the studies under this comparison reported this outcome. None of the studies under this comparison reported this outcome. None of the studies under this comparison reported this outcome. None of the studies under this comparison reported this outcome. None of the studies under this comparison reported this outcome. None of the studies under this comparison reported this outcome. The findings of this review were based on five reports of four included studies (see Figure 1 ).One trial compared bethanechol versus placebo (Madeiro 2006) .Three studies compared SPC versus ISC (Nwabineli 1993; Suprasert 2002; Naik 2005) . • No information on the rate of spontaneous voiding recovery at one week following operation was reported in any of the included studies.QoL, adverse events, and subjective urinary symptoms were rarely assessed in the current evidence. We identified five published reports from four RCTs that included two comparisons of the interventions given to prevent bladder dysfunction a er radical hysterectomy for cervical cancer including bethanechol versus placebo and SPC versus ISC.The primary outcomes of this review were the rate of spontaneous voiding recovery at one week a er surgery and QoL.However, none of the studies reported the rate of spontaneous voiding recovery one week a er surgery.In addition, only one trial assessed QoL, but data were insu icient for assessing the e ect of the intervention. Applicability of evidence is limited by the quantity and certainty of the review results.The lack of data regarding primary outcomes of interest in almost all included studies and the very low certainty of available evidence may impede the applicability of the review findings.It is thus di icult to make any adequate judgements regarding the e ectiveness of the interventions assessed in this review.Additionally, it is important to note that the surgical techniques applied in almost all of the participants were conventional laparotomy radical hysterectomy.Therefore, the results may not be fully applicable to other surgical techniques (i.e.laparoscopic radical hysterectomy or nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy). In the protocol, we planned to assess the certainty of evidence by eleven relevant outcomes including the rate of spontaneous voiding recovery at one week a er surgery, QoL, time a er surgery to a post-void residual urine volume of 50 mL or less, adverse events, post-void residual urine volume at one month a er surgery, rate of urinary tract infection in the first month a er surgery, and subjective urinary symptoms (Aue-aungkul 2017). As the review included only four studies, we obtained evidence from few studies and small number of participants for each comparison.Using GRADE assessments, we graded the certainty of the evidence as follows. • Bethanechol versus placebo: information on post-void residual urine volume assessed at one month a er surgery was downgraded to very low certainty evidence due to important imprecision (combination of sparse data and a low number of events) and unclear risk of selection bias.No information on the rate of spontaneous voiding recovery at one week following the operation, QoL, adverse events, urinary tract infection in the first month a er surgery, and subjective urinary symptoms were reported under this comparison (see Summary of findings 1). With assistance from the Information Specialist of the Cochrane Gynaecological, Neuro-oncology and Orphan Cancers Group, we were able to conduct a comprehensive literature search, including a search of the grey literature, conference proceedings and abstracts, citation lists of included studies, and registered databases of ongoing studies.In addition, bias was minimised in terms of the overall review process by following the recommendations in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2019) . As this review included only four studies, there remains the possibility of publication bias.We did not perform a funnel plot, as the analyses were limited to only one or two studies.Because of the small number of included studies, we did not carry out sensitivity and subgroup analyses as planned in the review protocol (Aueaungkul 2017).None of the review authors have any links to drug companies or financial interest in the prescription of the drug under evaluation, nor did they participate in the conduct of any of the included trials.Therefore, there were no known conflicts of interest of the authors of this review.Kietpeerakool 2019 recently reported a Cochrane Review and metaanalysis assessing the e ectiveness and potential harms of nervesparing radical hysterectomy in women with early-stage cervical cancer.Nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy is a modified surgical technique developed to permit surgical removal (resection) of oncologically relevant tissues surrounding the cervical cancer lesion while preserving pelvic autonomic nerves.This review noted that the nerve-sparing technique may lessen the risk of postoperative bladder dysfunction compared to the conventional radical hysterectomy.Nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy reduced postoperative bladder dysfunctions in terms of a shorter time to post-void residual urine volume of 50 mL or less (mean di erence (MD) -13.21 days, 95% CI -24.02 to -2.41; low certainty evidence) and lower volume of post-void residual urine measured one month following operation (MD -9.59 days, 95% CI -16.28 to -2.90; low certainty evidence). To date, our review is the first systematic review evaluating the e ectiveness and safety of various postoperative interventions for preventing bladder dysfunction a er radical hysterectomy for early-stage cervical cancer.Limited evidence suggested that bethanechol may minimise the risk of bladder dysfunction a er radical hysterectomy by means of lower post-void residual urine volume assessed one month a er surgery and better results of urodynamic assessment.The e ectiveness of di erent types of postoperative urinary catheterisation (suprapubic and intermittent self-catheterisation), however, remained unproven by available evidence obtained from RCTs.In a retrospective cohort study conducted among women with early-stage cervical cancer who underwent radical hysterectomy, postoperative SPC was associated with shorter time to trial of voiding and lower urinary tract infection compared to transurethral catheterisation (Wells 2008). There are no RCTs assessing the e ectiveness of bladder training for preventing bladder dysfunction following radical hysterectomy with a focus on women with early-stage cervical cancer.Three reports of two RCTs assessing bladder training following radical hysterectomy which included women with early-stage and locally advanced-stage cervical cancer failed to note the e ectiveness of this intervention (Santaguida 2012; Fanfani 2015; Gong 2016).One RCT reported in Santaguida 2012 and Fanfani 2015 found that the median duration of time a er surgery to a post-void residual urine volume of 100 mL or less was four days in the bladder training group (range 1 day to 40 days) and three days in the control group (range 1 day to 30 days).Gong 2016 reported no di erence in the risk of urinary tract infections during the first month a er surgery between the women assigned to bladder training (22.9%) and women in the control group (20.3%).Based on these findings, the e ectiveness of bladder training for preventing bladder dysfunction following radical hysterectomy for cervical cancer, therefore, remained unconfirmed. In general, the studies included in this review are very small, and thus make inferences challenging in the face of very low certainty evidence.None of the included studies reported the primary outcomes and various important secondary outcomes that this review aimed to assess (i.e.rate of spontaneous voiding recovery one week a er surgery, time to a post-void residual urine volume of 50 mL or less, and post-void residual urine volumes at 6 and 12 months a er surgery. Very low-certainty evidence obtained from one small RCT indicated that bethanechol may minimise the risk of bladder dysfunction a er radical hysterectomy by means of lower post-void residual urine volume assessed at one month a er surgery and better results of the urodynamic assessment.However, there was a lack of data regarding clinically important outcomes (i.e.rate of spontaneous voiding recovery, QoL, adverse events, urinary tract infection, and subjective urinary symptoms).There was insu icient evidence to indicate whether SPC lessens the risk of bladder dysfunction following radical hysterectomy. In light of the results of this review, bethanechol may be an option for the treatment of bladder dysfunction following radical hysterectomy.However, the benefits and harms of this cholinomimetic drug need to be reassessed in further adequately powered, high-quality RCTs.If this pharmacological intervention can be shown to prevent bladder dysfunction, additional information regarding optimal dose and duration of treatment are required. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. In addition, particular attention should be paid to an assessment of a combination therapy with bethanechol and an alpha-adrenergic blocker, which was shown to be more e ective than bethanechol alone in a previous RCT conducted among patients with various causes of underactive bladder (Yamanishi 2004; Kim 2017). Importantly, any further studies should encompass an evaluation of the rate of spontaneous voiding recovery, QoL, time to a postvoid residual urine volume of 50 mL or less, post-void residual urine volume, adverse events, and urinary tract infections which are clinically important outcomes for clinical-decision making.Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews -Quality of life (EORTC QLQ C30) questionnaire at 3 weeks, 6 weeks and 12 weeks following surgery Notes -The ISC protocol consisted of insertion of a transurethral indwelling catheter at the time of surgery which remained on free drainage until day 5, at which time it was withdrawn and the patient commenced ISC.ISC was continued until satisfactory frequency/volumes and RUVs were achieved (minimum 200 mL of urine, at least four hourly during the day, with residual urine volumes of < 100 mL). -The SPC protocol consisted of insertion of a Bonanno suprapubic catheter at the time of surgery followed by free drainage until day 5 at which time it was clamped.Patients were then requested to pass urine at least every 4 hours during the day following which the RUV was measured by releasing the clamp.SPC was continued until satisfactory frequency/volumes and RUVs as described above were achieved. During the operation, all patients had an indwelling free draining Foley\\'s catheter. At the end of the operation, a Becton-Dickenson Bonanno catheter was inserted if randomisation had indicated a suprapubic catheter and the urethral catheter was removed.In those patients randomised to receive urethral catheters, this was le in situ. Trial of voiding started on the fi h postoperative day.Catheters were removed when the residual urine was ≤ 100 mL.Antibiotics were not administered routinely in the postoperative period.Daily catheter specimens of urine were examined bacteriologically daily until the catheters were removed except in patients who went home with their catheters in situ. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Study duration: September 1998 to June 1999 Participants 81 stage IB1-IIA cervical cancer patients who underwent radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy (RHPL).At the end of the RHPL operation, the participants were allocated immediately into the intermittent self-catheterisation (N=38) or the suprapubic catheterisation (N=33) group before abdominal closure. Exclusion criteria included abnormal preoperative bladder function or urinary analysis, urinary tract infection more than 2 times per year, history of renal stone, bladder calculi, urinary incontinence, intraoperative bowel or urinary tract complication, and inability to perform Intermittent self-catheterisation (ISC). -Control group: suprapubic catheterisation Suprapubic catheter was placed through a small bladder incision and exited through a separated skin incision.The catheter in this group was clamped on day 7 postoperatively for 4 hours and was released after self-voiding to check the post voiding residual (PVR) urine. -Intervention group: intermittent self-catheterisation (ISC) The ISC group was managed by indwelling transurethral Foley\\'s catheter for 7 days.On day 6, the patient was instructed to do ISC until she could confidently perform by herself.When the Foley\\'s catheter was removed on day 8, the ISC was performed every 4 hours after each voiding and the PVR urine was recorded. -In both groups, ISC and SPC were discontinued when the PVR was < 75 ml for 2 consecutive voids. Outcomes -Febrile morbidity -The voiding time (days) -Rate of urinary tract infection Notes -Urine analysis was performed weekly until the ISC or SPC was discontinued. -Bacteriuria was defined as urinary culture showed the organism more than 10 5 colonies/mL. -Prolonged bladder dysfunction was defined as the voiding time was longer than 30 days. -Febrile morbidity was defined as two consecutive oral temperatures ≥ 38˚ C, at least 6 hours apart excluding the first 24 hours after operation.Mean Difference IV, Random, 95% CI -14.00 [-23.73 , -4.27] -8.25 [-17.65 Total (95% CI) Total events: Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.00; Chi² = 0.05, df = 1 (P = 0.82); I² = 0% Test for overall effect: Z = 1.34 (P = 0.18) Test for subgroup differences: Not applicable Postoperative interventions for preventing bladder dysfunction a er radical hysterectomy in women with early-stage cervical cancer (Review)Copyright © 2021 The Cochrane Collaboration.Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\\n\\n==================================================\\n\\nFile: Automated-identification-of-rare-sperm-becomes-pos.grobid.tei.json\\nTitle: Automated identification of rare sperm becomes possible: Is sperm selection the next frontier in male infertility?\\nAuthors: Lewin [] Staine, Jaden [\\'R\\'] Kohn, Taylor [\\'P\\'] Kohn\\nAbstract: \\nBody Text: identification of rare sperm becomes possible: Is sperm selection the next frontier in male infertility? Treatment modalities that help men with infertility achieve their goal of having a healthy child have undergone multiple stepwise advancements over the years-from assisted reproductive technology and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) to the use of microscopic sperm extraction techniques to diagnostic technologies such as whole-genome sequencing and sperm function testing (1) .Advancements such as microscopic sperm extraction have allowed physicians to be more efficient in collecting seminiferous tubules that are more likely to contain sperms (2); however, laboratory tissue processing after microscopic collection remains a challenge because the process is currently performed manually; can require 12-14 hours of careful examination; and is dependent on the examiner\\'s level of expertise, fatigue, and ability to visualize sperms (3) .The automation of this tedious process could facilitate greater efficiency of andrology laboratory personnel and supplement their initial searches, which could be especially helpful in cases of nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA).Lee et al. ( 4) demonstrated this automation in their study; the investigators used a machine learning algorithm to detect rare sperm in microscopic testicular sperm extraction samples from men with NOA using bright-field microscopy.The investigators trained their convolutional neural network using bright-field images paired with fluorescenttagged sperm images to establish the ground truth before algorithm validation.Overall, the algorithm had 95.8% sensitivity, with a 91% positive predictive value.Lee et al. ( 4) demonstrated the ingenious use of machine learning technology to provide an additional tool for laboratory personnel while searching for sperms in men with NOA. Automation to identify sperms in the andrology laboratory could allow more efficient and more effective identification of rare sperms, which would be a substantial advancement in the field of male infertility.However, although sperm identification remains crucial, there are currently no nondestructive technologies or processes that allow the evaluation of the quality of the sperm after it is retrieved.The next breakthrough in sperm collection and processing will be the identification of the most viable sperm for use in ICSI or sperm selection.Embryo selection has undergone significant advancements over the years; the current modalities of embryo assessment rely either on embryo growth over a period of days and subsequent grading based on subjective morphology or destructive testing of nonessential cells in the trophectoderm (preimplantation genetic testing); neither of these options can be applied to sperm selection.As such, novel modalities for sperm selection will need to be developed; the most promising approach may be through nondestructive imaging techniques.Technologies such as Raman spectroscopy and quantitative phase imaging provide the ability to assess cellular contents, including aneuploidy, methylation, and DNA packaging, all of which could help identify sperms that can lead to the most optimal embryonic development (5) .As technologies such as machine learning to automate rare sperm identification become more widespread and potentially allow for the identification of a few rare sperms in men who previously had no sperms identified, the subsequent selection of the most optimal sperm for use in ICSI will become more and more essential.We believe that continued, stepwise advancements and wide implementation of these technologies will further help couples with infertility achieve their goal of a healthy child.\\n\\n==================================================\\n\\nFile: Automated-rare-sperm-identification-from-low-magni.grobid.tei.json\\nTitle: Automated rare sperm identification from low-magnification microscopy images of dissociated microsurgical testicular sperm extraction samples using deep learning\\nAuthors: Ryan [] Lee, Luke [] Witherspoon, Meghan [] Robinson, Jeong [\\'Hyun\\'] Lee, Simon [\\'P\\'] Duffy, Ryan [] Flannigan, Hongshen [] Ma\\nAbstract: Objective: To develop a machine learning algorithm to detect rare human sperm in semen and microsurgical testicular sperm extraction (microTESE) samples using bright-field (BF) microscopy for nonobstructive azoospermia patients.Design: Spermatozoa were collected from fertile men.Testis biopsies were collected from microTESE samples determined to be clinically negative for sperm.A convolutional neural network based on the U-Net architecture was trained using 35,761 BF image patches with fluorescent ground truth image pairs to segment sperm.The algorithm was validated using 7,663 image patches.The algorithm was tested using 7,663 image patches containing abundant sperm, as well as 7,985 image patches containing rare sperm.Setting: In vitro fertilization center and university laboratories.Patient(s): Normospermic and nonobstructive azoospermia patients.Intervention(s): None.Main Outcome Measure(s): Precision (positive predictive value [PPV]), recall (sensitivity), and F1-score of detected sperm locations.Result(s): For sperm-only samples, our algorithm achieved 91% PPV, 95.8% sensitivity, and 93.3% F1-score at Â10 magnification.For dissociated microTESE samples doped with an abundant quantity of sperm, our algorithm achieved 84.0%PPV, 72.7% sensitivity, and 77.9% F1-score.For dissociated microTESE samples doped with rare sperm, our algorithm achieved 84.4% PPV, 86.1% sensitivity, and 85.2% F1-score.Conclusion(s): Rare sperm can be detected in patients\\' testis biopsy samples for potential subsequent use in in vitro fertilizationintracytoplasmic sperm injection.A machine learning algorithm can use BF images at Â10 magnification to accurately detect sperm locations using automated imaging.\\nBody Text: ver 30 million men worldwide are infertile (1) .Approximately 15% of infertile men suffer from azoospermia (1) , the most severe form of male infertility in which there is no detectable sperm in the ejaculate.In azoospermic men, 40% have nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA) that results from a defect in sperm production.To help these couples conceive via in vitro fertilization (IVF), sperm is extracted directly from the testis through a process known as microsurgical testicular sperm extraction (micro-TESE).Retrieved sperm is then injected into oocytes via intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) with the aim of achieving fertilization and pregnancy that ultimately results in a healthy live birth.For NOA patients, the success rate of micro-TESE is approximately 45%, which translates to a live birth rate of only 13%, leaving the majority of these couples with no options for fertility (2) . The primary reasons for microTESE failure include the lack of sperm production and the inability to find extremely rare sperm among the millions of testicular cells in the micro-TESE specimen.Biopsied tissues are mechanically and enzymatically digested into a single cell suspension.An andrologist then evaluates the suspension using microscopy to identify and isolate approximately 10 sperm from an estimated 10-50 million testicular cells-a 0.0001%-0.00002%event rate.Currently, andrologists must spend hours manually searching through tens of thousands of microscopy fields to identify and retrieve sperm cells for NOA patients.As a result, most IVF facilities are only able to search through a fraction of the available sample, and because of extremely low event rates, there is a significant risk of missing rare sperm (3) .Thus, the success rates of IVF for NOA patients are currently limited by human cognition and patience. There have been previous attempts to improve microTESE identification of sperm with fluorescent-activated cell sorting, which identified sperm in 3 of 7 negative microTESE samples, supporting the rationale for this study (3) .However, this approach requires fluorescence staining of the sperm in the mi-croTESE sample and incurs cellular shear stress during fluorescent-activated cell sorting, which may pose challenges for clinical use.Attempts have been made to automate sperm identification via microscopy using traditional image analysis, as well as machine learning.Traditional image analysis uses techniques, such as thresholding, edge detection, morphologic transformations, elliptical masks, and color spaces to segment sperm from other cells and debris (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) .These approaches are typically not robust across different specimens.Some success has been found in reviewing microscopic video footage to identify sperm based on their motility (10, 11) .However, sperm in testis biopsies are typically less motile than sperm in semen.Recently, deep learning has been used to directly detect sperm in semen from microscopy images, identify DNA fragmentation, and select high-quality sperm for ICSI (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) .These studies demonstrate that deep learning could extract useful information from bright-field (BF) images of sperm.However, the sample must be imaged at high magnification (>Â40), which is incompatible with the need to search through all available biopsy tissue to detect rare sperm. To improve the success rate of IVF-ICSI for NOA patients, we developed an artificial intelligence algorithm to automate the identification of rare sperm from semen and testis biopsy samples.This capability dramatically increases the amount of testis biopsy tissue that could be examined comprehensively to increase the chance of finding viable sperm for ICSI.This capability would also free andrologists from an arduous task to make the overall ICSI process more efficient and successful, which ultimately, will help couples devastated by NOA to achieve their dream of starting a family. This study accessed fertile control semen samples and micro-TESE samples from our departmental biobank which is approved by the University of British Columbia clinical research ethics board (H18-03543) and requires informed consent.MicroTESE samples were derived from patients diagnosed with NOA defined through 2 azoospermic semen analyses, elevated serum follicle-stimulating hormone levels, and small testes on examination.Specifically, negative microTESE samples were used in this study in which no sperm was found after approximately 2 hours of surgically searching the testicular tissue with an operating microscope at Â20 magnification.These research samples were retrieved at the end of the microTESE case after all clinical samples were acquired.Samples were dissociated into single cells by digestion in 4.5 mL 0.25% Trypsin-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (25200-056; GIBCO Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) with 4 kU of DNase I (11284932001; Roche, Basel, Switzerland) for 5 minutes at 37 C and triturated 3-5 times, for 3 cycles for a total of 15 minutes of digestion.The reaction was stopped by adding 450 mL fetal bovine serum (A4766801, GIBCO Laboratories), and the cells were filtered using 70 mm followed by 40 mm filters, centrifuged at 600 Â g for 15 minutes, and resuspended in imaging buffer.A total of 3 microTESE biopsies from different patients were processed (separately). Experiments in this study pertaining to machine learning methods to detect sperm were performed under the University of British Columbia clinical research ethics board (H19-00792).Within 30 minutes of a fresh semen donation, the sample was transferred to a 15 mL centrifuge tube and a needle was used to pop all the bubbles in the sample.The tube was then secured at an angle of 45 and 2 mL of the swim-up medium (made from 38 mL Dulbecco\\'s modified Eagle\\'s medium/F12 [11320-033, GIBCO], 100 mL Lactate [L4263; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO], 10 mL of 50 mg/mL human serum albumin [A1653, Sigma-Aldrich], 0.5 mL HEPES buffer solution [15630-080, GIBCO], and 272 mL sodium pyruvate [S8636, Sigma-Aldrich]) was gently layered on top of the semen sample to perform the sperm swim-up, in which the motile sperm swim upwards past the boundary into the swim-up medium, leaving behind other cells, debris, and nonmotile sperm in the semen.For washes, all centrifugation was spun at 400 Â g for 5 minutes.After 20 minutes of the swim-up process, the top 70% of the uniform unclouded swim-up medium was extracted slowly using a large-bore pipette tip to avoid suction of the semen sample.To confirm a successful swim-up, 10 mL of the swim-up medium was viewed under a microscope on a glass slide to ensure that it only contains sperm cells with negligible debris or nonsperm cells.Sperm cells were washed and resuspended in 500 mL of phosphate-buffered saline and then 10 mL/mL formalin was added to fix the sperm.At 15 minutes after adding the formalin, the cells were washed and resuspended in 500 mL of 0.1% Triton X-100 for permeabilization.At 30 minutes after resuspension in Triton X-100, the sample was washed again and resuspended in 500 mL of phosphatebuffered saline.Sperm cells were stained with 1 mL/mL LIVE/DEAD Fixable Aqua Dead Cell Stain (L34957; Invitrogen, Waltham, MA) and left at room temperature (with the container wrapped in aluminum foil) for 30 minutes to allow the stain to fully permeate.An amine-reactive dye was necessary to prevent dye leakage into the testis cells using the dye\\'s covalent bonds.After 2 more sperm cell washes in phosphatebuffered saline, sperm cells and microTESE cells were serially diluted and aliquoted at low density into Greiner Sensoplate 96-well glass-bottom multiwell plates (M4187-16EA, Sigma-Aldrich) such that there was minimal overlap between cells under the microscope after plate centrifugation.Before imaging, each well was layered with 15 mL of Ovoil oil (10029; Vitrolife, San Diego, CA), a total volume of the contents in each well is 120 mL after adding the Ovoil oil. Microscopy imaging was performed using a Nikon (Tokyo, Japan) Ti-2E inverted fluorescence microscope.Microscope objectives included Nikon CFI Plain Fluor Â4, Â10, and Â20 objectives.Image acquisition was performed using a 14-bit Nikon DS-Qi2 CMOS camera.Images were acquired in BF with phase contrast, as well as in fluorescence in the mCherry channel (Nikon C-FLL LFOV, 562/40 nm excitation, 641/75 nm emission, and 593 dichroic mirror).Brightfield imaging was illuminated by the built-in Ti-2E LED.Epifluorescence excitation was performed using a 130 W mercury lamp (Nikon C-HGFI).Exposure, gain, and vertical offset were determined automatically using built-in Nikon Instruments Software (NIS) functions to avoid user bias.Cells were imaged in Greiner Sensoplate 96-well glassbottom multiwell plates (M4187-16EA, Sigma-Aldrich).Cell concentrations in the wells were diluted down to approximately 30,000-50,000 cells to lower overlap between cells.NIS Jobs was used to automatically capture 21 images on each of the 2 channels for each well.Bright-field microscopy and fluorescent imaging were done concurrently through automated imaging for each imaged location.The images were exported from NIS to standard 8-bit TIFF format.Of all imaged cells, sperm cells made up 3%-25% of the training set and less than 1% of the rare sperm testing set, varied for the training set for diversification of the training data set. TIFF files exported from Nikon NIS were preprocessed using a custom Python script using SciKit and OpenCV libraries.The script extracted and resized 2,424 Â 2,424-pixel TIFF images to 2,304 Â 2,304-pixel images.The resized images were each sliced into 81 256 Â 256-pixel image patches.Image patches were filtered to remove well edges and out-offocus images.Bright-field images outside the well or on the well edges where the images are out of focus were removed from the data set.Subsequently, out-of-focus fluorescent labels were filtered out by removing all labels that had over a fifth of its total area labeled as sperm.Additionally, the BF patches were filtered for undesirable lighting conditions and well edges by ensuring that their average pixel intensity ranged between 70 and 230, or were removed otherwise.Bright-field images are converted to 3 channels to match the model input.This process is repeated for each stack of TIFF images. The convolutional neural network (CNN) based on the U-Net architecture was designed in Python using Tensorflow\\'s Keras library.The network accepts a 3-channel input of size 256 Â 256 pixels and outputs a single-channel output of size 256 Â 256 pixels.All input data are normalized to between À1 to 1, inclusive.All 2-dimensional (2D) convolutions have a kernel size of 3 Â 3, the same padding, he_normal initialization, and exponential linear unit activation.The filter size begins at 16 and doubles after every second convolution until the end of the encoder segment after the tenth convolution with a filter size of 256.Each pair of 2D convolutions in the encoder is followed by a 2 Â 2 max pooling operation.The decoder starts with a series of up-convolutions with a kernel size of 2 Â 2 and 128 filter size, concatenation with the same shaped output from the encoder, and then pairs of convolutions with the same filter size, halving until the end of the encoder after every second 2D convolution.Between every pair of 2D convolutions, we tested an increasing dropout that increments from 0.1 until 0.5 and decrements back down to 0.1 after each pair of convolutions in intervals of 0.1, as well as a constant dropout of 0.5.The output 1 Â 1 convolution with sigmoid activation outputs confidence values between 0 and 1. The software was run on a single computer operating Windows 10 with an Intel i7-7700 running at 3.6 GHz.There was 32 GB of DDR4 RAM running at 2400 MHz.The graphics card was a 2 GB GT 730.The training was performed in Python 3.7 using the Keras 1.1.2library. The network was trained on 10 epochs with Adam optimization and a learning rate of 0.001 with a batch size of 8.The EarlyStopping and Checkpoint functions in Keras were used to save copies of the model before the tenth epoch to minimize overfitting.The weighted binary cross-entropy loss function was used to train the model, in which the log loss from false negatives is scaled up by the ratio of background pixels and sperm pixels over the entire training data set.Accuracy and dice loss were used to observe model performance during training.Using the ImageDataGenerator in Keras, data augmentation was applied to all training inputs, including rotations of 45 in either direction, zooming in or out between Â0.8 and Â1.2 magnification, vertical and horizontal image shifting of up to Â0.4 the width or height, brightness adjustments of Â0.8 to Â1.2, vertical and horizontal flips, and a reflecting fill when augmentations leave blank space. The single-channel 256 Â 256-pixel output from the model prediction was binarized using a threshold optimized on the validation set during testing.Using the distance_transfor-m_edt function in SciPy, the binary image was transformed into a map where all sperm pixels were the Euclidean pixel distance away from the background pixels.All the peaks within the Euclidean map were found with a minimum 6pixel separation distance between peaks using peak_local_max function in SciKit and each peak was uniquely labeled using the label function in SciPy before passing the labels and an inverted version of the Euclidean distance map into the watershed algorithm.For each unique label, the watershed algorithm determined the contour surrounding each label.Each sperm instance was visualized on the original BF image using a minimum enclosing circle and number around the predicted sperm head.Inference with described hardware requires approximately 3 seconds for all 81 256 Â 256-pixel BF patches, combined for a full Â10 microscopy field search.Image patches were combined back together and rescaled to the original resolution, providing an accurate position in the full BF image, and correspondingly in the well using known coordinates from the microscopy software. Our overall approach to automated rare sperm identification was to use a CNN to perform pixel-based classification of microscopy images from testis biopsies (Fig. 1 ).To train the CNN, purified sperm cells were first isolated from semen samples using a swim-up procedure.The purified sperm cells were then fixed to make them nonmotile and fluorescently stained using an amine-reactive dye.These sperm cells were doped into testis biopsy samples from NOA patients confirmed to have no sperm by a clinical andrologist.The doped samples were imaged using BF and fluorescence microscopy.The fluorescence images were processed to generate a ground truth of the locations of doped sperm cells to train the CNN to perform a pixel-based classification on the BF images.The output of the CNN was a probability map of potential sperm objects.Finally, the probability distribution was processed to identify and locate individual sperm cells.The performance of our CNN model can be evaluated by comparing detected sperm from BF images against ground truth labels obtained from Overall approach for artificial intelligence-based rare sperm detection system.Sperm purified by swim-up is fixed, fluorescently stained, and doped into a testis biopsy, which is imaged to create a training set for deep learning.A U-Net convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained using brightfield images against ground truth obtained by processing the fluorescence images.The trained CNN performs pixel-based classification to obtain a probability distribution, which is analyzed to detect individual sperm. Lee. Automated rare sperm identification.Fertil Steril 2022. fluorescence images.Before applying this approach to sperm doped into testis biopsy samples, we initially used this image analysis pipeline to analyze purified sperm samples without background cells to determine the upper bound on performance and optimal imaging magnification. Bright-field and fluorescence images of sperm and testis cells were acquired as 8-bit 2,424 Â 2,424-pixel images from the microscope camera.We developed a Python program to resize and slice the images into 81 256Â 256-pixel bitmap image patches to eliminate low-quality regions and reduce the memory requirements for the training environment.The patches were filtered and inspected to remove well edges, as well as areas with unusually high fluorescence, large clumps, or no sperm to produce a high-quality training set with minimal outliers.To create the ground truth, the fluorescence images were thresholded to produce a binary image (Fig. 2A and B ).The ground truth threshold was determined by analyzing fluorescence images of purified sperm samples to detect the sperm head.The data set then was split into a 70%, 15%, and 15% ratio with 35,761, 7,663, and 7,663 patches for training, validation, and testing data sets, respectively, by random selection.This data set split allowed sufficient diversity in the training images while isolating sufficient validation and testing images to produce a robust model evaluation. We designed a CNN based on the U-Net architecture to segment images into sperm and nonsperm pixels using the Keras library in Tensorflow.U-Net is a fully convolutional encoder-decoder network architecture with a proven ability to segment medical images and conduct transfer learning with minimal data (19) .This network uses an equal number of up-sampling and down-sampling layers that form a symmetric contracting and expanding path.Unlike patch-based CNNs, the network can use the full context of each image via skip connections that concatenate features from opposing convolution and deconvolution layers (Supplemental Fig. 1 , available online).Several differences can be highlighted between the original U-Net architecture and our design.Specifically, we used exponential linear unit activation instead of rectified linear unit activation to avoid the dying rectified linear unit problem, and dropout layers were used to regularize the model.Although U-Net did not use dropout layers, to regularize the network, we used 2 different styles of dropout that were trained and compared: a constant 50% dropout, as well as increasing dropouts in the encoder and decreasing dropouts in the decoder.The model input is a 3stacked grayscale 8-bit 256 Â 256-pixel image, such that all 2 Â 2 max pooling operations are applied to a layer with even height and width as suggested by U-Net, normalized about 0 between -1 and 1.We used padded 3 Â 3 convolutions in place of unpadded 3 Â 3 convolutions to maintain the input and output height and width, but kept the stride of 2. For weight initialization, instead of a regular normal distribution used by the U-Net, we used a truncated normal distribution to avoid rare outlier weights but kept the standard deviation of ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 2=N p , in which N is the number of input units in the weight tensor.The energy function is computed pixel-wise using the two-class sigmoid function rather than the multiclass softmax function.The network uses a weighted binary cross-entropy loss function instead of an unweighted version, as well as the Adam optimizer with an initial learning rate of 0.01.This loss function increases the log loss of incorrectly segmenting sperm by the ratio of background to sperm pixels in the entire training data set.The output segmentation was binarized into a single-layered 8-bit 256 Â 256-pixel image for postprocessing. To detect each sperm and acquire its location, we postprocessed the CNN probability map (Fig. 2C ) to perform instance segmentation.The CNN probability map initially was thresholded into a binary mask containing only high-confidence sperm pixels (Fig. 2D ).The binary mask was then transformed into a Euclidean distance map, such that all sperm pixels are a minimum Euclidean distance from the background labels (Fig. 2E ).The local peaks within the distance map were found and tagged with a unique label.The watershed algorithm was then applied to the combination of unique labels and the inverse Euclidean distance map was used to calculate the contours surrounding each unique peak by flooding the inverse peaks to determine the contour boundaries.Each sperm instance within an image patch could then be visualized with a circle and number using the unique contours that surround each peak found using the watershed algorithm (Fig. 2F ) to evaluate the model performance.Interestingly, although sperm tails were not labeled on the ground truth images, tails were labeled on the probability maps produced by the CNN (Fig. 2C ), which confirms that the presence of the tail is being used by the CNN to identify sperm cells. We measured the performance of the model by comparing the predicted sperm locations with the ground truth.If the predicted sperm location was within the approximate radius of the sperm head (6 pixels for images taken using a Â10 objective), the predicted sperm was labeled as a true positive.Otherwise, the predicted sperm was labeled as a false positive.All missed ground truth sperm were labeled as false negatives and no predicted sperm was counted twice.By labeling and counting the number of true positives, false positives, and false negatives (Supplemental Fig. 2 ), we calculated the precision (positive predictive value [PPV]), recall (sensitivity), and F1-scores for each tested data set to evaluate the performance of the model.The parameters of the watershed algorithm, including the binarization threshold, the maximum distance threshold to be considered a \\'\\'nearby sperm,\\'\\' and the confidence threshold for binarization were optimized through empirical testing with a resolution of 1 pixel. Imaging magnification has a tremendous impact on the amount of tissue that can be analyzed because the time required for microscopy increases as the inverse square of the magnification.For example, a Â4 magnification objective can image 25 times the amount of biopsy tissue that a Â20 objective can image.To determine the optimal imaging resolution for large area scans, we evaluated sperm detection accuracy by training our CNN using microscopy images acquired at Â20, Â10, and Â4 magnification.To ensure that identical images were used for this test, the Â10 and Â4 images were down-sampled from Â20 images.At Â4 magnification, the sperm head is detected using approximately 8 pixels and is barely recognizable by human cognition (Fig. 3A ).At Â10 and Â20, the sperm head is detected using approximately 50 and approximately 200 pixels, respectively, and is easily recognizable by human cognition (Fig. 3B and C ).Training models at all 3 magnifications used a sample containing 68,041 sperm cells, and we observed that sperm detection metrics improved with magnification from Â4 (PPV, 77.8%; sensitivity, 69.7%; and F1 73.5%) to Â10 (PPV, 91%; sensitivity, 95.8%; and F1-score, 93.3%), and Â20 magnification (PPV, 97.6%; sensitivity, 94.2%; and F1-score, 95.9%; Fig. 3D ).For the purpose of rare sperm detection, it is desirable to maximize the throughput.However, we selected Â10 magnification for the subsequent study to ensure that sperm detection is sufficiently robust in the more complex microTESE samples. We tested our approach for identifying sperm in testis biopsies imaged using the Â10 microscope objective.We trained a new CNN model by doping purified sperm cells into testis biopsies from NOA patients who have been clinically determined to be azoospermic.As before, the purified sperm was stained using an amine-reactive dye to create a ground truth (Supplemental Fig. 3 ).The testis biopsy sample was then imaged in BF (Fig. 4A ) and fluorescence.After preprocessing to eliminate low-quality images, the fluorescence images were binarized using an empirically tested threshold dependent on microscopy gain, exposure time, and physical microscope, to provide ground truth images for training the CNN model to detect sperm in the BF images (Fig. 4B ).The output of the CNN was a probability map of the likelihood of pixels containing sperm (Fig. 4C ).We then binarized the probability map and applied a watershed algorithm to obtain a Euclidean distance map (Fig. 4D and E ).Local maxima points were identified and provided with a unique label.As before, the sperm tails were detected in the probability map even though the training images had no sperm tails (Fig. 4C and F ). To optimize sperm detection from the probability map (Fig. 4C ), we varied the binarization threshold and the resolution of the watershed algorithm\\'s output contour radius with the goal of obtaining the greatest F1-score.The binarization threshold controls the required model prediction confidence reflected in its output probability maps for cells to possibly be sperm cells.The minimum contour radius directly controls the confidence area for a cell to be labeled as a sperm.Using detected sperm locations, we measured the model performance on the validation data set, which was then used to optimize the aforementioned binarizing threshold with a resolution of 0.01 and minimum contour radius with a resolution of 1 pixel.The combination of parameters that yielded the highest F1-score was selected to be the optimal model.We optimized F1-scores for 2 dropout styles: increasing/ decreasing dropouts and a constant 50% dropout.The former achieved 78.7% (Fig. 4G ) and the latter 74.8%.In summary, our CNN could successfully identify sperm in testis biopsy samples with an F1-score of 78.7%. Additionally, to establish the consistency of our results, we validated our results using 5-fold cross-validation.The training set was split into 5 equally sized and randomly distributed groups of images.We trained the U-Net using 4 of the groups and tested it on the fifth group.All 5 groups were tested after repeating this process 4 times (PPV, 84.0%; sensitivity, 72.7%; and F1-score, 77.9%), which is similar to the performance from initial testing. To investigate the use case of identifying rare sperm in testis biopsies from NOA patients in which there could be only a few sperm cells among millions of testis cells, we simulated this clinical application using sperm doped artificially into testis biopsy samples that were inspected by andrologists to contain no sperm.We first purified donor sperm from semen samples using a swim-up assay.The purified sperm cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained using an amine-reactive dye.The stained sperm were then doped in low numbers into disassociated testis biopsy cells in microwell plates.Each well had 10 to 200 sperm cells and approximately 30,000 to 50,000 cells from the testis biopsy (Supplemental Fig. 3 ).The model was trained previously by doping sperm into mi-croTESE samples at a higher density (3,000-6,000 sperm per well) and was not retrained before testing on the rare sperm data set.Our model was able to detect 2,969 sperm cells out of a total of 3,517 sperm in the 7,985 image patches imaged from 38 wells (PPV, 84.4%; sensitivity, 86.1%; and F1score, 85.2%; Fig. 4G ), which was an improvement over the identification of abundant sperm in testis biopsies.These results demonstrated that a low frequency of sperm does not negatively affect the sperm detection in the model. Identifying rare sperm from testis biopsies of NOA patients is an arduous task that is currently limited by human cognition and patience.Automating this task using computational image analysis provides an opportunity to dramatically increase the amount of tissue that can be assessed, thereby increasing the chance of finding rare sperm for ICSI.In this study, we developed a deep learning algorithm to detect and count sperm cells in BF images.Specifically, we developed a CNN based on the U-Net architecture to identify sperm through pixel classification of microscopy images of testis biopsies.We trained the CNN using fluorescently stained donor sperm that are doped into testis biopsy samples from NOA patients.This CNN produces a probability map of potential pixels belonging to sperm cells, which is then analyzed to determine the position of each detected sperm.The probability map can be rendered and overlaid on the image to confirm cell identity and assess performance.Overall, our CNN was able to detect rare sperm from BF images with a sensitivity of 86.1% and an F1-score of 85.2%. For microTESE samples from NOA patients, manual microscopic searching for sperm is currently performed by andrologists using a microscope at Â20 or Â40 magnification for up to 4-6 hours (20).This process could easily miss rare sperm because of the relative abundance of testis cells in the microTESE sample, as well as human error associated with inexperience and fatigue (21) .Sperm detection algorithms have been previously developed using traditional image analysis approaches, such as thresholding, edge detection, morphologic transformations, elliptical masks, and color spaces (4-9).However, these approaches typically require high magnification imaging that limits their throughput (22) .As a result, these methods are typically used to count sperm in semen samples, in which it is much easier to identify sperm from media and a few nonsperm cells.Our approach using a CNN to analyze microscopy images could detect rare sperm from cell images at Â10 magnification, which increases imaging throughput by factors of 4 and 16 over Â20 and Â40 imaging.After automated imaging, the sperm locations can then be preserved for subsequent retrieval for ICSI. The to perform automated detection of rare sperm from BF microscopy images offers tremendous potential for increasing the success rate and reducing the time required for sperm retrieval from microTESE.Using automated imaging and a machine learning algorithm, we could robustly detect sperm locations from Â10 magnification of BF images.This capability can be readily integrated into clinical settings where standard microscopy imaging systems already exist to guide the identification and retrieval of rare sperm.

There are notable knowledge gaps among adolescents and young people regarding LARCs, such as eligibility criteria, the reversibility of long-acting options, and misconceptions regarding infertility.Clinicians should specifically counsel regarding the suitability for LARCs in nulliparous populations and that LARCs do not cause infertility.\\nBody Text: dolescents and young people are high-risk populations for unintended pregnancy, largely due to the inconsistent or ineffective use of contraception (1, 2) .As such, long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) have been highly recommended by both the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Academy of Pediatrics for adolescent use (3, 4) .Long-acting reversible contraceptives typically include hormonal and nonhormonal intrauterine devices (IUDs) and subdermal implants (Table 1 ) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) .There is some variability on whether medroxyprogesterone injections are classified as either long-acting or short-acting because their effects last for 3-4 months (4) .Particularly among adolescents, LARCs have higher success, continuation, and satisfaction rates than short-acting contraceptives, such as condoms or oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) (3, 4) .There is very little user error with LARCs, and recipients can achieve continuous contraception for up to 10 years with certain LARCs, such as the copper IUD (17) .In addition, adolescents do not experience a higher risk of complications from LARCs than older women, despite misconceptions to the contrary (18) . Despite their numerous benefits, several adolescents and young adults do not seek out LARCs for contraceptive use (19, 20) .The reasons for poor uptake are multifactorial, including the lack of provider or parental knowledge, relative privacy of short-acting contraceptives such as condoms, and high cost of certain LARCs (3) .While patient preference is the priority in contraceptive choice, several adolescents lack the knowledge to properly engage in evidenceinformed decision-making (4) .Across all age groups, studies have noted misconceptions regarding LARCs as well as contraception in general (5, 21, 22) .As LARCs are a relatively new advent in reproductive health, it is important that providers address the potential gaps in knowledge to encourage evidence-informed choices for adolescents and young adults. The objective of this systematic review was to determine the awareness of LARCs in young people and characterize knowledge gaps, predictors of knowledge, and information sources by adolescents. This systematic review was conducted according to the standards and guidelines established in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses and the fourth edition of the Joanna Briggs Institute Reviewer\\'s Manual.We consulted 2 University of Toronto research librarians when developing our search strategy, in addition to having the search strategy peer-reviewed by 2 gynecologists using the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies guidelines (23) .We systematically searched 3 databases: MEDLINE-Ovid; Embase-Ovid; and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature from April 16, 2001, to April 16, 2021 .The cutoff of the last 2 decades was selected to improve the relevance of the review, considering as the Mirena IUD system was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2001 (24) . We maintained a broad approach with our search criteria to maximize sensitivity.Our search strategy is included in Supplemental Table 1 (available online). Only original, peer-reviewed observational studies were examined.Conference posters and abstracts were not eligible for inclusion. Studies of adolescents and young adults aged 12-25 years with a uterus and/or assigned female at birth, including cisgender women, transmen, and nonbinary people, were eligible for inclusion.The eligible age group was based on cutoffs from previous systematic reviews.We did not include studies specific to cisgender men in our systematic review because we aimed to only assess the knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs of people who would be eligible for LARC use.We excluded studies that did not report outcomes specific to adolescents or young people (i.e., if the results were combined with other age groups and did not stratify by age). Articles that did not specifically discuss LARCs or combined outcomes related to LARCs with other methods of contraception or methods of sterilization were excluded from review.Studies were only eligible if either selfreported knowledge or knowledge assessments were included; as such, studies that explored attitudes, barriers, or facilitators beyond knowledge (e.g., cost, fear of pain, and confidentiality) were excluded.Studies in which the objective was solely related to knowledge regarding emergency contraception (e.g., the insertion of a copper IUD for the purpose of preventing implantation of a pregnancy) were also excluded.Articles assessing the knowledge of healthcare providers (HCPs) or healthcare/medical sciences students were excluded.There were no limitations according to language or country of origin. All steps of the systematic review were performed in duplicate.Study selection was completed by 2 independent, parallel reviewers (M.Y., X.L., or A.K.) for title and abstract screening as well as full-text screening.Any discrepancies were resolved via consensus.Data extraction was also performed by 2 independent reviewers, with 1 reviewer (A.K.) extracting all included articles and an additional reviewer (either M.Y. or X.L.) leading the second round of extraction.Discrepancies were resolved via discussion between the 2 reviewers and subsequent consultation with the third reviewer. The Covidence platform was used for deduplication, screening, and data management of initial database searches (25) .The manual search was completed using the Scopus platform. The primary outcome was the prevalence of young people who were aware of at least 1 LARC method.Awareness was defined as whether a participant had heard of an LARC method or could recognize its name.The secondary outcomes included the following: the prevalence of young people who were aware of specific LARC methods (e.g., IUD and subdermal implant); predictors of LARC awareness; specific knowledge and misconceptions surrounding LARC use; and information sources of young people.We conducted both quantitative and qualitative syntheses to summarize the heterogeneous study designs and methodologies.For studies that included cisgender male participants as well as participants assigned female at birth, only outcomes specific to participants assigned female at birth were included in either analysis. Articles were included in the quantitative synthesis if a questionnaire was as part of the methodology and the entire subset of the study population was surveyed.Articles were included in the qualitative synthesis if they included any patient-reported outcomes related to knowledge or information sources related to LARCs, including but not limited to understanding of the safety, mechanism of action, eligibility, insertion, efficacy, and usage of LARCs. For the quantitative synthesis, all statistical analyses were conducted through R version 4.0.5.Confidence intervals (CIs) were set at 95%, and P values of < .05were considered statistically significant.I 2 was used to quantify heterogeneity between studies.The prevalence of participants who were aware of at least 1 type of LARC, as well as the prevalence of awareness of specific LARC types (including IUDs, subdermal implants, and injections), was pooled using randomeffects meta-analyses.Prevalence was also pooled for key misconceptions, such as the percentage of participants who believed that LARCs cause infertility, are not suitable for nulliparous people, protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and require daily action.For the primary outcome, univariate random-effects meta-regression was conducted to determine the effects of predictors on participant awareness.Predictors were decided a priori and included the year of publication, region of study, risk of bias, postsecondary education, prevalence of pregnancy, and prevalence of sexual activity.Funnel plots and Egger test were used to assess publication bias (26) . For the qualitative synthesis, additional knowledge gaps and misconceptions were summarized using thematic analysis determined by 2 independent reviewers (A.K. and X.L.) on the basis of data extraction (performed by A.K., X.L., and M.Y.). The risk of bias was judged using an adapted tool version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, which has previously been used in other similar studies (27) (28) (29) . The search yielded 4,077 original database citations after deduplication.Of these, 112 full-text articles were eligible for full-text screening after the manual search.A total of 40 articles were included in the systematic review. The details of the specific studies are included in Supplemental Table 2 (available online) . The 40 studies included a total of 10,470 participants.Studies specifically targeted undergraduate students, and 2 studies specifically recruited postpartum adolescents.Most studies were located across the United States (28/40), with the remainder set in Brazil (n ¼ 1), Ethiopia (n ¼ 1), Jamaica (n ¼ 1), the United Kingdom (n ¼ 3), Botswana (n ¼ 1), Norway (n ¼ 1), the Netherlands (n ¼ 1), or Oceania (n ¼ 3). The majority (19/40) included either surveys or questionnaires, with the remainder including interviews (n ¼ 13), focus groups (n ¼ 3), or mixed methodology (n ¼ 5).Eighteen studies were graded as low risk of bias, whereas 22 studies were graded as high risk of bias (Supplemental Table 3 , available online) . The studies evaluated multiple methods of LARCs, including hormonal and/or nonhormonal IUDs (n ¼ 38), subdermal implants (n ¼ 31), and hormonal injections (n ¼ 13).The results are summarized in Tables 2 and 3 , and forest and funnel plots are shown in Supplemental Figures 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 (available online). None of the included studies were reported as sponsorinitiated or included conflicts of interest related to pharmaceutical companies that manufacture or sell contraceptive products. A total of 17 questionnaire-based studies evaluated the primary outcome of LARC awareness (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) (35) (36) (37) (38) (39) (40) (41) (42) (43) (44) (45) (46) .Of the 6,897 participants surveyed, a pooled prevalence of 65.0% (95% CI, 51-78) had awareness of at least 1 LARC method or could recognize at least 1 LARC name.There was significant heterogeneity (I 2 ¼ 100%).The meta-regression noted that the region (P¼ .078),risk of bias (P¼ .249),prevalence of pregnancy (P¼ .744),prevalence of sexual activity (P ¼ .859),prevalence of participants who have had tried 1 LARC method (P¼ .869),and proportion of participants who had postsecondary education (P¼ .546)were not significant predictors of LARC awareness.The year of publication noted a potential trend where the awareness of LARCs increased by 13.2% per increasing year of publication, although this trend was not technically significant (P ¼ .068). Publication bias was assessed for the primary outcome.Visual inspection of the funnel plot noted some horizontal asymmetry, although Egger test was not significant (P¼ .199). The random-effects models were performed for the prevalence of participants who had heard of each specific LARC method.In 13 studies of 4,232 participants, there was a pooled prevalence of 60.0% for individuals who had heard of the IUD, although there was high heterogeneity (I 2 ¼ 97%) (30, (33) (34) (35) (36) (37) (38) (39) (42) (43) (44) (45) (46) .In comparison, 50.0% of participants (n ¼ 9 studies, n ¼ 3,315 participants) had heard of the subdermal implant, again with significant heterogeneity (I 2 ¼ 99%) (30, 33, 34, 36, 39-41, 43, 44) .Only 3 questionnaire-based studies examined whether participants had heard of the long-acting injection, with 80% of 1,351 participants hearing of this method (30, 33, 39) .There was little evidence of heterogeneity for the studies that had heard of the long-acting injection (I 2 ¼ 36%). Only 2 studies had comparative data for the number of participants who were aware of OCPs (30, 34) , preventing the meta-analysis of comparison of short-acting methods.They noted that 75 of 90 and 1,037 of 1,067 participants were aware of OCPs, respectively. We found that 32 of the included 40 studies assessed participants\\' knowledge related to LARCs.Specifically, 10 of the 32 studies featured objective knowledge assessments, including multiple-choice questions and true/false statements.In contrast, 19 studies assessed patient-reported and spontaneously described knowledge, and the remaining 3 studies assessed both perceived knowledge and objective knowledge. All included studies identified knowledge gaps related to safety, effects on fertility, mechanism of action, protection from STIs, eligibility, insertion, efficacy, and/or usage of LARCs (Table 2 ).Safety.Overall, 19 studies reported knowledge gaps regarding the safety of LARCs, whereas 2 reported satisfactory knowledge.One knowledge assessment noted that 71.0% of adolescent girls and young people did not understand the safety profile of IUDs (37) .Five studies reported the concerns that LARCs were unsafe because of potential infection (36, 47, 48) , cancer (44) , permanent harm (36) , and/or premature menopause (48) .Five studies reported the misconception that the lack of menstruation with an LARC was abnormal and/or unhealthy (42, 44, (49) (50) (51) .Another study noted the fear that IUD insertion could cause death, which was spontaneously reported by a participant.There was also a concern of physical damage to the reproductive system (\\'\\'There\\'s so much damage that could be done with that.You know, your ovaries and tubes and stuff, those are all really fragile\\'\\') (49) .Studies also noted the misconception that subdermal implants could move throughout the body or dissolve within the skin (52) or stick out of the skin (36) or that IUDs could become permanently stuck within the uterus (48) .Another study noted the misconception that the copper IUD could rust within the body, which was spontaneously reported as a fear by 2 participants (64) .Effects on fertility.Ten studies (n ¼ 4,011 participants) used a questionnaire methodology to assess whether participants believed that LARC use would cause infertility when removed (31-33, 39, 41, 42, 44, 53-55) .A pooled prevalence using the random-effects models noted that 37.0% (95% CI, 21-56) of participants believed that LARCs cause infertility, with significant heterogeneity (I 2 ¼ 98%, t2 ¼ 0.85, P < .01).Similarly, 8 additional studies using other methodologies (e.g., interviews and focus groups) found that fear of infertility was a significant barrier to LARC use (36, 46, 47, 49, (56) (57) (58) . Five studies noted a poor understanding of the mechanism of action of IUDs.Specifically, 3 studies reported that participants did not know that hormonal IUDs contained hormones, specifically progestins (32, 42, 44) .One study noted that 74.2% of participants did not realize that the hormonal effects of IUDs would mean that menstrual flow could be decreased (42) .One study noted that participants incorrectly believed that hormonal IUDs contained more hormones than combined OCPs (49) .In another study, a participant noted the belief that IUDs \\'\\'seal the uterus and ovaries\\'\\' (59) .Protection from STIs.Three studies used a questionnairebased methodology to assess whether participants understood that LARCs cannot provide protection against STIs (33, 41, 42) .A pooled prevalence of 44.0% of participants understood this disadvantage (I 2 ¼ 92%).Another interviewbased study found that participants self-identified the lack of protection from STIs as a disadvantage of implants (40) . Efficacy.Eight studies reported variable understanding of the high efficacy of LARCs (37, 46, 53, (56) (57) (58) (59) (60) .Two knowledge assessments noted that 30.7% and 55.5% of participants understood that LARCs were among the most effective methods of contraception (59) .In 4 studies, participants spontaneously described knowledge that LARCs were extremely efficacious.However, in 2 other studies, participants assumed that LARCs were less effective than other methods, such as condoms or combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs).In another study, 1 participant self-reported that she was concerned that the implant may be less efficacious because it was relatively new on the market (40) . Eligibility.Nine studies noted the misconception that LARCs, specifically IUDs, are not recommended for nulliparous or young people (32, 36, 41, 42, 53, 57, (61) (62) (63) .Of the 5 objective knowledge assessments, 62% (95% CI, 20-91) of 2,541 participants did not understand that IUDs could be used without prior pregnancy (I 2 ¼ 99%) (32, 33, 41, 42, 53) .One study noted that HCPs often misinformed adolescent patients about their eligibility because of the misconception that nulliparous women cannot tolerate an IUD (63) . Insertion.Four studies examined misconceptions related to IUD insertion and LARC use.Two studies noted the misconception that IUD insertion would require surgery and anesthesia (44, 57) .In 1 of the studies, a participant stated: \\'\\'I don\\'t want people cutting me open so that they can put that in there\\'\\' (57) .Another study noted that participants were surprised by the size of the IUD, believing that it was much larger in width (61) .Finally, 1 study noted the spontaneously reported belief that subdermal hormonal implants could be inserted as tracking devices (52) . Usage.Three questionnaire-based studies assessed whether participants understood that LARCs did not require daily reminders or action before sexual intercourse (33, 41, 42) .A pooled prevalence of 46% of 337 participants described this understanding (I 2 ¼ 94%).Four additional interview and focus group-based studies also noted that participants had a mixed understanding of this advantage of LARC use (31, 37, 42, 59, 60, 70, 71) .In 4 studies, several participants did not realize that IUDs could be removed early if desired or not tolerated (32, 44, 50, 53) .In 1 study, it was unclear whether participants realized that implants could be removed early because there was concern in case participants wanted to start a family in <3 years (40) . Of the 4 studies that examined knowledge regarding side effects, there was variable knowledge.Two studies reported poor knowledge of side effects (32, 42) .Two studies reported a good understanding of implant-related side effects, such as irregular bleeding (41) . Fourteen studies reported the information sources of the participants regarding LARCs.Common sources included HCPs (n ¼ 12), friends/family members (n ¼ 11), the Internet (n ¼ 2), and advertisements/commercials (n ¼ 3).Five studies reported that informal sources of information were preferable to HCPs, although 4 studies noted the opposite finding.One study mentioned that participants preferred nurses to physicians as sources of information because of their approachability (61) .Although 3 studies noted that information about LARCs was garnered from sexual education classes, 1 study specifically reported that sexual education classes only discussed condoms and CHCs (64) . This systematic review describes the awareness, knowledge, and misconceptions of >10,000 adolescents and young people regarding LARCs.After screening 4,077 studies, we included 40 observational studies in our review.We found that over a third of adolescents and young people were not aware of at least 1 LARC method, although there was high heterogeneity in the included studies.The risk of bias, parity, study region, prevalence of postgraduate education, and sexual activity were not significant predictors of awareness.There was a potential trend toward increased awareness with each subsequent year of publication, although this was not significant.There were notable knowledge gaps related to safety, mechanism of action, eligibility, insertion, efficacy, and usage of LARCs.Most prominently, 62% of participants believed that IUDs are not suitable for nulliparous women, and 37% of participants believed that LARCs can cause infertility. The findings of our review align with the findings of existing literature.Previous studies have noted that young people and adolescents have overall poor knowledge of contraception and sexual health, with several misconceptions perpetuated by social references and mass media (72) (73) (74) (75) .Low-quality sexual education and the promotion of abstinence in schools may also play a role in the weaker knowledge of LARCs, as noted in 1 of our included studies (64, (76) (77) (78) .As such, there has been recent interest in educational programs to promote LARC awareness and knowledge among adolescents and young people.The Contraceptive CHOICE Project noted that when adolescents were counseled thoroughly on all contraceptive methods and offered treatment at no cost, the majority chose LARC methods (79) .Previous initiatives, such as peer-to-peer counseling and iOS applications, have improved the reproductive knowledge and, in turn, long-term contraception use of adolescents (80) (81) (82) (83) .Our findings also highlight the importance of involving friends and family members in these educational programs because of their influence on young peoples\\' help-seeking behavior (58, 65, 84) . There are several practical takeaways from this systematic review.For one, it is evident that providers should increase the amount of counseling regarding LARCs because over a third of participants were not aware of LARC methods.However, counseling should be tailored to adolescents and young adults.Specifically, throughout the included studies, there were commonly repeated misconceptions that LARCs can impact fertility or are not suitable for nulliparous people.On the basis of the findings of this systematic review, we suggest that these misconceptions are clarified routinely at contraceptive visits for young people because participants may not readily share these concerns.Educational materials for young people should also dispel these 2 misconceptions specifically.Similarly, it is concerning that several studies have noted that physicians often propagated the misconception that IUDs are not suitable for young people.Past research of provider perspectives has noted similar findings that several physicians believe that IUDs are not suitable for nulliparous women (85) (86) (87) (88) (89) (90) (91) .As such, medical school curriculums and continuing education courses should ensure that HCPs are adequately educated regarding LARC guidelines in young people. Further research should also be conducted to determine differences between international contexts because most of our included studies were in the United States.For example, according the 2019 United Nations Contraceptive Use by Method data booklet (92), Canada\\'s estimated prevalence of IUD use among women of reproductive age in 2019 was 1.6%, whereas in the United States, it was 8.3%.It is possible that decreased usage rates in Canada could signify decreased understanding of LARCs, in addition to variations in availability and pricing.Another example is that the Nexplanon subdermal implant only recently approved by Health Canada in 2020 (93) .Our systematic review notes that participants had low awareness of the implant as well as misconceptions regarding its safety and efficacy, even in countries such as the United Kingdom and United States that have approved subdermal implants for longer periods of time.As such, HCPs should continuously update their counseling on the basis of the most current options for their unique context. Ultimately, it is important for adolescents and young people to receive accurate, thorough contraceptive counseling.However, we emphasize that the purpose of contraceptive counseling should not be to pressure patients into selecting LARCs as the most suitable option.In addition, counseling alone may not be sufficient to improve adolescent uptake of contraception.Adolescents may face specific barriers to LARCs, such as the lack of autonomy to visit a physician independently or concerns regarding confidentiality (94, 95) .Other barriers may include the high cost of LARCs, which may be alleviated through the free provision of contraception (48, 79, 96) .Others may prefer the systemic effects of CHCs for the protection against acne or the dual benefit of condoms for STI protection (4).Several young patients also report a fear of peri-insertional pain with IUDs and pelvic examinations, which providers should acknowledge through increased efforts to improve patient comfort (48) .For example, there is growing evidence that lidocaine gel and paracervical blocks may improve IUD peri-insertional pain among nulliparous patients specifically, although further evidence is required (97-101).In addition, there should be ample opportunities to strengthen pelvic examination skills as well as IUD insertion (e.g., workshops and simulation) to improve provider familiarity before LARC provision to young people and adolescents (102-104).Therefore, beyond providing information, contraceptive provision should be tailored to the patient\\'s unique preferences, concerns, and expectations. The strengths of our systematic review include our robust and rigorous search of 3 databases, including screening of all citing articles and citations via Scopus.We consulted 2 University of Toronto research librarians when developing our search strategy, in addition to having the search strategy peer-reviewed by 2 gynecologists using the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies guidelines.In addition, we did not apply any exclusions on the basis of language or country of origin.We conducted a robust meta-analysis with statistically sound methodology and guidance from multiple statisticians. Our most significant limitation was the high degree of heterogeneity of the included studies.As such, the pooled results should be taken with caution, and further research is warranted in the field.Explanations for heterogeneity were thought to include the risk of bias, year of publication, and region as well as the participants\\' gravidity, sexual history, previous LARC experience, or education level.As such, a meta-regression was performed using these predictors but did not reach significance for any of these variables.Ultimately, the reproductive knowledge of young people is a complex social phenomenon that may involve specific cultural beliefs or attitudes, school systems\\' sex education curriculums, parenting strategies, or local availability of contraceptives.As such, heterogeneity of beliefs may not be captured by traditional reporting in medical journals and require further investigation through systematic and ethnographic study. Other limitations included publication bias because we did not examine gray literature.Instead, we only examined peer-reviewed literature for the sake of methodologic quality and method transparency.Furthermore, we only included articles that self-identified as studying knowledge related to LARCs in their title or abstract as well as articles flagged via the manual search.Therefore, as with any systematic review, there is a potential for articles to have been missed in our systematic search, although we have taken several steps to avoid the potential for missed articles.In addition, because we included a broad range of studies, findings may not be generalizable to all geographic regions, health systems, or study populations.We also did not report findings specific to cisgender male participants in our review, who may have partners who can become pregnant.As partners can significantly influence the contraceptive choice of young people, future initiatives should address the previously documented evidence gaps of cisgender male participants (65, 105-107).Finally, future studies may also investigate patient perceptions and knowledge gaps of LARCs in contexts other than contraception, such as the use of the hormonal IUD for endometriosis because the IUD is underused for this purpose as well (108). In conclusion, there are notable gaps in the understanding of LARCs among adolescents and young people, which may influence evidence-informed decision-making.Healthcare providers should specifically counsel young people about the suitability for LARCs in nulliparous populations as well as the safety of LARCs for future fertility.

We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility (CGF) Group trials register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL and two trials registers up to 17 October 2019, together with reference checking and contact with study authors for missing or unpublished data. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing IUI with TI or expectant management, both in stimulated or natural cycles, or IUI in stimulated cycles with IUI in natural cycles in couples with unexplained subfertility. Two review authors independently performed study selection, quality assessment and data extraction.Primary review outcomes were live birth rate and multiple pregnancy rate. We include 15 trials with 2068 women.The evidence was of very low to moderate quality.The main limitation was very serious imprecision. It is uncertain whether treatment with IUI in a natural cycle improves live birth rate compared to treatment with expectant management in a natural cycle (odds ratio (OR) 1.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92 to 2.78; 1 RCT, 334 women; low-quality evidence).If we assume the chance of a live birth with expectant management in a natural cycle to be 16%, that of IUI in a natural cycle would be between 15% It is uncertain whether treatment with IUI in a stimulated cycle improves live birth rates compared to treatment with TI in a stimulated cycle (OR 1.59, 95% CI 0.88 to 2.88; 2 RCTs, 208 women; I 2 = 72%; low-quality evidence).If we assume the chance of achieving a live birth with TI in a stimulated cycle was 26%, the chance with IUI in a stimulated cycle would be between 23% and 50%.It is uncertain whether treatment with IUI in a stimulated cycle reduces multiple pregnancy rates compared to control (OR 1.46, 95% CI 0.55 to 3.87; 4 RCTs, 316 women; I 2 = 0%; low-quality evidence). In couples with a low prediction score of natural conception, treatment with IUI combined with clomiphene citrate or letrozole probably results in a higher live birth rate compared to treatment with expectant management in a natural cycle (OR 4.48, 95% CI 2.00 to 10.01; 1 RCT; 201 women; moderate-quality evidence).If we assume the chance of a live birth with expectant management in a natural cycle was 9%, the chance of a live birth with IUI in a stimulated cycle would be between 17% and 50%.It is uncertain whether treatment with IUI in a stimulated cycle results in a lower multiple pregnancy rate compared to control (OR 3.01, 95% CI 0.47 to 19.28; 2 RCTs, 454 women; I 2 = 0%; low-quality evidence). Treatment with IUI in a natural cycle probably results in a higher cumulative live birth rate compared to treatment with expectant management in a stimulated cycle (OR 1.95, 95% CI 1.10 to 3.44; 1 RCT, 342 women: moderate-quality evidence).If we assume the chance of a live birth with expectant management in a stimulated cycle was 13%, the chance of a live birth with IUI in a natural cycle would be between 14% and 34%.It is uncertain whether treatment with IUI in a natural cycle results in a lower multiple pregnancy rate compared to control (OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.07 to 16.90; 1 RCT, 342 women; low-quality evidence). Treatment with IUI in a stimulated cycle may result in a higher cumulative live birth rate compared to treatment with IUI in a natural cycle (OR 2.07, 95% CI 1.22 to 3.50; 4 RCTs, 396 women; I 2 = 0%; low-quality evidence).If we assume the chance of a live birth with IUI in a natural cycle was 14%, the chance of a live birth with IUI in a stimulated cycle would be between 17% and 36%.It is uncertain whether treatment with IUI in a stimulated cycle results in a higher multiple pregnancy rate compared to control (OR 3.00, 95% CI 0.11 to 78.27; 2 RCTs, 65 women; low-quality evidence). Due to insu icient data, it is uncertain whether treatment with IUI with or without OH compared to timed intercourse or expectant management with or without OH improves cumulative live birth rates with acceptable multiple pregnancy rates in couples with unexplained subfertility.However, treatment with IUI with OH probably results in a higher cumulative live birth rate compared to expectant management without OH in couples with a low prediction score of natural conception.Similarly, treatment with IUI in a natural cycle probably results in a higher cumulative live birth rate compared to treatment with timed intercourse with OH.Treatment with IUI in a stimulated cycle may result in a higher cumulative live birth rate compared to treatment with IUI in a natural cycle. Does treatment with intra-uterine insemination (IUI), with or without fertility drugs, compared to timed intercourse or expectant management (watchful waiting) with or without fertility drugs, or treatment with IUI with fertility drugs compared to IUI without fertility drugs improve live birth rates in couples with unexplained subfertility?Background IUI is a treatment o en used for couples with unexplained subfertility.In an IUI cycle, the male partner\\'s sperm is prepared and placed directly in the womb around the time of ovulation.IUI cycles can be used in combination with fertility drugs to increase the number of available eggs.However, these drugs can have side e ects, and also increase the risk of multiple pregnancies.Expectant management and timed intercourse have also been shown to increase pregnancy rates, resulting in live births.With this review, we would like to enhance decision-making for couples starting treatment for unexplained subfertility. For most treatment groups, it is uncertain whether treatment with one IUI treatment type improves cumulative live birth rates (i.e.rates at the end of a course of treatment) with acceptable multiple pregnancy rates when compared to another treatment type.However, there is moderate-quality evidence that, in couples with a low chance of natural conception, treatment with IUI combined with fertility drugs probably improves cumulative live birth rates compared to treatment with expectant management.Similarly, there is moderate-quality evidence that treatment with IUI alone probably improves cumulative live birth rates compared to treatment with expectant management combined with fertility drugs. The evidence was of low to moderate quality for cumulative live birth and of low quality for multiple pregnancy.The main limitation of the evidence was a lack of precision in the findings, due to the inclusion of few studies with small sample sizes. Intra-uterine insemination (IUI) is a commonly-used treatment in couples with unexplained subfertility.IUI is a relatively simple procedure in which semen is \\'washed\\' in the laboratory and inserted in the uterine cavity using a small catheter at the time of ovulation.IUI can be performed with or without drugs for ovarian hyperstimulation (OH).For correct timing of the insemination, cycle monitoring is performed.This is usually done by ultrasound assessment of follicle growth or by monitoring the pre-ovulatory luteinising hormone rise in blood or urine.In hyperstimulated cycles, ovulation is o en induced by an injection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which improves timing possibilities. In contrast to IUI procedure, with expectant management couples either receive cycle monitoring for correct timing of sexual intercourse, i.e. timed intercourse (TI), or no intervention at all. The rationale for performing IUI is that the motile spermatozoa, which are morphologically normal, can be concentrated in a small volume and placed directly into the uterus close to the released oocyte.In this way the cervix, which also acts as a reservoir for sperm, is bypassed.Accurate timing of the insemination is therefore of great importance.IUI can be performed with or without ovarian hyperstimulation (OH).The role of IUI in fertility treatment is o en debated, in particular whether or not it is superior to TI, and whether or not OH should be used at the same time (Cohlen 2005; Hughes 2003; Stewart 2003) .Commonlyused drugs for ovarian hyperstimulation are clomiphene citrate (CC) and aromatase inhibitors, such as letrozole, both of which are oral treatments, and gonadotropins which are administered by subcutaneous injection.The aim of OH is to increase the number of oocytes available for fertilisation and to enhance accurate timing. The use of OH in fertility treatment for unexplained subfertility is associated with benefits as well as increased risk of multiple pregnancies.When Hughes 1997 published a meta-analysis indicating that the average fecundability is approximately fivefold higher for treatment with IUI and OH, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG 1998) concluded accordingly that \"OH with IUI is an e ective treatment for couples with unexplained infertility\".However, major concerns were raised about the incidence of multiple pregnancies, and OH became less popular.These concerns have resulted in an adjustment of the advice for treatment of couples with unexplained subfertility.The NICE fertility guideline states that \"ovarian hyperstimulation should not be o ered to women with unexplained subfertility\" (NICE 2013). The increase in multiple pregnancies is a logical consequence of stimulated growth of multiple follicles.The incidence of multiple pregnancies a er treatment with OH and IUI varies between 10% and 40%, and the overall contribution of this treatment to multiple births is estimated to be around 30% (Fauser 2005).However, recent studies have reported lower incidence of multiple pregnancies with OH.For example, a recent randomised controlled trial has reported multiple pregnancy rates of between 1.4% and 2.2% with OH (Danhof 2018) ; rates of between 3% and 10% have also been reported in another trial (Diamond 2015) .The question is whether this multiple pregnancy rate is acceptable or whether it can be reduced to acceptable numbers.Recently, more evidence has been collected showing that mild ovarian hyperstimulation with strict cancellation criteria reduces the risk of achieving multiple pregnancies to approximately 10%, without compromising pregnancy rates (ESHRE 2006; Ragni 2006; Van Rumste 2006) .Because maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality rates are significantly increased in multiple pregnancies (Fauser 2005; Ombelet 2005 ), caregivers should take extra care to keep the multiple pregnancy rate to a minimum.Couples should be well-informed by their physicians, especially as many couples wish to conceive twins (Ryan 2004 ) and prefer a higher pregnancy chance over safety. Some authors have stated that treatment with OH results in an unacceptably high incidence of high-order multiple pregnancies (Gleicher 2000; Nan 1994) (Balasch 2004 ).As IVF allows better control over reducing the risk of a multiple pregnancy (Gleicher 2000) , and IVF with single-embryo transfer is becoming more accepted, it has been argued that IVF is a safer treatment option than IUI with OH. Although ovarian hyperstimulation seems to result in higher pregnancy rates, it also increases the risk of multiple pregnancies and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS Criteria for considering studies for this review Published and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were eligible for inclusion.We excluded non-randomised studies (e.g.studies with evidence of inadequate sequence generation such as alternate days, patient numbers) as they are associated with a high risk of bias.We attempted to contact the author of the study if the randomisation or allocation method was unclear. We excluded trials that did not report separate data for women with unexplained subfertility or where such data were not obtainable from the authors.We assessed the trial design (cross-over or parallel) and included cross-over trials if we could extract pre-crossover data. I. Couples with unexplained subfertility, defined as follows. 1. Normal ovulatory status (determined by either biphasic basal body temperature chart, normal luteal progesterone, in-phase endometrial biopsy or ovulation detected with ultrasound).2. Tubal patency (determined by hysterosalpingography or laparoscopy, or both).3. A normal semen sample according to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria current at the time of the trial. II. Couples who had tried to conceive for at least one year. Participants excluded were: couples with a known cause of infertility including a moderate male factor, moderate to severe endometriosis (according to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) classification), tubal disease, or a cervical factor. We contacted study authors to obtain data of couples with unexplained infertility if groups with mixed infertility causes were studied.If we could not extract relevant data separately for included participants, we excluded the study. We excluded trials of participants with mild to moderate endometriosis only. Trials with at least one of the following comparisons: We included expectant management as a variant of timed intercourse. We excluded the following interventions: 1. intra-cervical insemination, because we consider this to be a di erent treatment modality (Ripps 1994) and it is the topic of another Cochrane Review (Kop 2018); 2. donor insemination.We excluded pregnancies confirmed only by detection of hCG in serum or urine (biochemical pregnancies).When pregnancy was not further defined, and remained unclear even a er contacting the authors, we assumed the pregnancy to be clinical. We searched for all reports which describe (or might describe) randomised controlled trials of IUI with or without OH, in couples with unexplained infertility.The original search was performed in 2005 and was last updated in October 2019, in consultation with the Gynaecology and Fertility Group (CGF) Information Specialist. We searched: We handsearched reference lists of articles retrieved by the search and contacted experts in the field to obtain additional data.We also handsearched relevant journals and conference abstracts that were not covered in the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility register, in liaison with the Information Specialist. A er an initial screening of titles and abstracts produced by the search, we retrieved the full texts of all potentially eligible studies.Two review authors (ROA and JDA) independently examined these full-text articles for compliance with the inclusion criteria and selected studies eligible for inclusion in the 2020 update.We contacted study investigators as required, to clarify study eligibility.We resolved any disagreements about study eligibility by discussion.We documented the selection process with a \\'PRISMA\\' flow chart (Liberati 2009) . Two review authors (ROA and JDA) independently extracted data from eligible studies using a data extraction form designed and pilot-tested by the review authors, resolving any disagreements by discussion.Data extracted included study characteristics and outcome data.Where studies had multiple publications the review authors collated multiple reports of the same study, so that each study, rather than each report, was the unit of interest in the review, and such studies had a single study ID with multiple references.We contacted study investigators for further data on methods or results, or both, as required. Two review authors (ROA and JDA) independently assessed the included studies for risks of bias using the Cochrane \\'Risk of bias\\' assessment tool (Higgins 2017) to assess: selection bias (random sequence generation and allocation concealment); performance bias (blinding of participants and personnel); detection bias (blinding of outcome assessors); attrition bias (incomplete outcome data); reporting bias (selective reporting); and other potential bias.We resolved disagreements by discussion or by involving a third review author.We described all judgements fully in the \\'Risk of bias\\' table for each included study and incorporated our judgements into the interpretation of the review findings. Only dichotomous data were reported in this review and we used the numbers of events in the control and intervention groups of each study to calculate Mantel-Haenszel odds ratios (ORs). We reversed the direction of e ect of individual studies, where required, to ensure consistency across trials.We presented 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for all outcomes.We assessed whether the estimates calculated in the review for individual studies were compatible in each case with the estimates reported in the study publications. We analysed data per randomised couple or woman, because pertreatment-cycle data may lead to biased results (Dias 2008 ).In the case of a cross-over trial, we only analysed data prior to cross-over. For studies where data did not allow analysis (e.g.per-cycle data) we contacted study authors for per-woman data.Where we could not obtain appropriate data a er contact with authors, we excluded such data (per-cycle) from meta-analyses.We counted multiple live births (e.g.twins or triplets) as one live birth event. We analysed the data on an intention-to-treat basis as far as possible.In the case of missing data we contacted authors of the published trials and included the newly-obtained data in the analysis.However, where the study authors did not provide additional data, we assumed that no live births occurred in participants without a reported outcome.We assumed that women who dropped out or were excluded a er randomisation were not pregnant.Women who were excluded because they conceived before receiving treatment were included as a success in the Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews allocated group in the ITT analysis.For other outcomes, we analysed only the available data. We considered whether the clinical and methodological characteristics of the included studies were su iciently similar for meta-analysis to provide a clinically meaningful summary.We assessed statistical heterogeneity using the I 2 statistic.We took an I 2 statistic measurement greater than 50% to indicate substantial heterogeneity (Deeks 2017) . In view of the di iculty of detecting and correcting for publication bias and other reporting biases, we minimised their potential impact by ensuring a comprehensive search for eligible studies and by being alert for duplication of data.Where there were 10 or more studies in an analysis, we had intended to use a funnel plot to explore the possibility of small-study e ects (a tendency for estimates of the intervention e ect to be more beneficial in smaller studies) (Sterne 2017 ). Where the studies were su iciently similar, we combined the data using a fixed-e ect model in the following comparisons: 1. Intra-uterine insemination (IUI) in a natural cycle versus timed intercourse (TI) or expectant management in a natural cycle; 2. IUI in a stimulated cycle versus TI or expectant management in a stimulated cycle; 3. IUI in a stimulated cycle versus TI or expectant management in a natural cycle; 4. IUI in a natural cycle versus TI or expectant management in a stimulated cycle; 5. IUI in a stimulated cycle versus IUI in a natural cycle. An increase in the odds of a particular outcome, which may be beneficial (e.g.live birth) or detrimental (e.g.adverse events), was displayed graphically in the meta-analyses to the right of the centre-line and a decrease in the odds of an outcome to the le of the centre-line. When pre-cross-over data were available, we included cross-over trials in the analysis and pooled them with parallel trials. Where data were available, we planned to conduct subgroup analyses to determine the separate evidence on the number of treatment cycles for live birth, and methods of ovarian hyperstimulation.However, there were insu icient data to perform subgroup analyses for the number of treatment cycles in any the comparisons, and for methods of ovarian hyperstimulation in some of the comparisons.We therefore did not report the findings by subgroups for any of the comparisons, except where data could not be pooled in meta-analyses due to the presence of high heterogeneity.Where a visual scan of the forest plots or the results of statistical tests indicated substantial heterogeneity, we explored possible explanations in the text or in subgroup analyses. Where appropriate, we performed sensitivity analyses for the review\\'s primary outcomes (live birth and multiple pregnancy) to determine whether the results were robust to decisions made during the review process.These analyses considered the e ects of excluding the following studies: 1. Studies that did not clearly describe adequate procedures for random sequence generation and allocation concealment; 2. Studies with a unit-of-analysis error (such as those in which cross-over data were analysed as if they derived from parallel studies). We prepared \\'Summary of findings\\' tables using GRADEpro so ware (GRADEpro GDT 2015) and Cochrane methods.These tables evaluate the overall quality of the body of evidence for the review outcomes (live birth, multiple pregnancy, pregnancy, OHSS, miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy) for the main review comparisons: 1. IUI versus TI or expectant management both in a natural cycle; 2. IUI in a stimulated cycle versus TI or expectant management in a stimulated cycle; 3. IUI in a stimulated cycle versus TI or expectant management in a natural cycle; 4. IUI in a natural cycle versus TI or expectant management in a stimulated cycle; and 5. IUI in a stimulated cycle versus IUI in a natural cycle). We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE criteria: risk of bias, consistency of e ect, indirectness, imprecision and publication bias (Schünemann 2017) .Two review authors working independently made judgements about evidence quality (high, moderate, low or very low), with disagreements resolved by discussion.We justified, documented, and incorporated our judgements into the reporting of results for each outcome. For the 2020 update, the searches identified 925 records (most of which were also identified during the previous updates) a er removal of duplicates.We retrieved three full-text articles, one of which was eligible for inclusion (Farquhar 2018).Fourteen studies were identified from the previous updates; we therefore include a total of 15 studies (21 references) in the review.See Figure 1 for details of the screening and selection process and Characteristics of included studies for studies included in the review. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. We tried to contact all study authors to retrieve unpublished details.Responses from three study authors resulted in the exclusion of the following trials: Nulsen 1993; Prentice 1995; Serhal 1988.Seven study authors (Agarwal 2004; Arici 1994; Bhattacharya 2008; Guzick 1999; Melis 1995; Murdoch 1991; Steures 2006a ) provided unpublished information or data, which we used in this analysis.Some authors could not provide us with the requested data, while others did not respond to our requests. We included 15 RCTs.All trials were published in journals (Janko 1998 was published as an abstract only) and were available in English.The trials were carried out in di erent countries: UK (Bhattacharya 2008; Chung 1995; Murdoch 1991) , USA (Arici 1994; Deaton 1990 ; Guzick 1999), Italy (Arcaini 1996; Melis 1995), the Netherlands (Goverde 2000; Steures 2006a) , India (Agarwal 2004), New Zealand (Farquhar 2018), Slovakia (Janko 1998), Sweden (Karlstrom 1993), and multiple European countries (Crosignani 1991). Twelve were parallel-group studies (Agarwal 2004; Arcaini 1996; Bhattacharya 2008; Chung 1995; Farquhar 2018; Goverde 2000; Guzick 1999; Janko 1998; Karlstrom 1993; Melis 1995; Murdoch 1991; Steures 2006a) , and three were cross-over studies (Arici 1994; Crosignani 1991; Deaton 1990) . Bhattacharya 2008 , Farquhar 2018 , Goverde 2000 and Steures 2006a were the only studies which performed a power calculation.All four studies reached the targeted inclusion number to obtain enough power (80% to 90% with 5% level of significance).Further details about the included trials are provided in the Characteristics of included studies table. The 15 trials comprised a total of 2068 women with unexplained subfertility. The ages of the women were mentioned in most trials as either a mean ± standard deviation (SD) or a median and range.One trial (Janko 1998) did not report the women\\'s ages.The overall age reported in the studies was similar.The mean or median age was between 30 years and 34 years (with comparable SDs).The maximum age of the participants was stated in six studies, only one of whom was above the age of 40 years (Arici 1994). The duration of subfertility was given in 11 trials and reported as a mean duration or range.Five studies only included couples with subfertility for more than at least three years.The overall subfertility duration ranged from one year to 15 years.Two studies used a prediction score of validated Hunault model (Hunault 2004 ), including women with a prediction score of natural conception of less than 30% (Farquhar 2018) or between 30% and 40% (Steures 2006a). The definition of unexplained subfertility was similar between studies.Six trials enrolled participants with unexplained subfertility only.Five trials also included participants with male factor subfertility.In those studies the data for unexplained subfertility were either reported separately or obtained from the authors.One study selected couples with unexplained subfertility and an intermediate prognosis (Steures 2006a) .Five studies reported the inclusion of women with either surgically-corrected endometriosis (Deaton 1990) , mild or stage II treated endometriosis (Guzick 1999) or minimal/mild endometriosis ( Bhattacharya 2008; Farquhar 2018; Karlstrom 1993) , which we considered to be unexplained subfertility.Melis 1995 specifically excluded participants if minor disorders such as minimal endometriosis were found in the investigation.Although our protocol stipulated only women with minimal and mild endometriosis, we decided to include Deaton 1990, despite the inclusion of three participants (out of 51 in total) with moderate endometriosis. All studies reported a thorough fertility investigation, including a laparoscopy.A semen analysis was performed at least once in all studies.In nine studies the semen quality was reported according to the WHO criteria.Two studies (Arcaini 1996; Janko 1998) did not specify the criteria for a normal semen analysis.Chung 1995 used a sperm count per ejaculate instead of per ml.The data in Guzick 1999 were based only on a normal sperm count and a normal motility according to Kruger criteria. Nine trials contained a mixed population of couples who had never achieved a pregnancy (primary subfertility) and those who had previously been pregnant (secondary subfertility).The remaining trials did not give any description for inclusion of people with secondary subfertility. Couples who have previously had failed fertility treatment have a lower probability of conception in subsequent treatment attempts.It is therefore important in fertility trials to report if couples have undergone previous treatment.Of the 15 included studies only two trials included couples who had previously had unsuccessful fertility treatment (Farquhar 2018; Melis 1995) .Five trials did not include previously-treated participants (Agarwal 2004; Arici 1994; Guzick 1999; Karlstrom 1993; Murdoch 1991) and the remaining trials did not provide information about previous treatment.The number of cycles in included studies ranged from one to eight. The most serious adverse e ects of ovarian hyperstimulation are multiple pregnancies and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).These risks can both be reduced by the cancellation of the treatment cycle if excessive follicle stimulation occurs.It is important that fertility trials report the cancellation criteria they applied.Firstly, this ensures that participants were not exposed to a higher risk of multiple pregnancy or OHSS to increase the pregnancy rate, and secondly, it reduces the bias introduced by cancellation of treatment in initially randomised groups. Eleven studies described criteria for cancellation of the treatment cycle.Insemination or hCG administration did not take place if the cancellation criteria were met.Six studies used serum-E 2 levels to determine over-or under-stimulation as well as a maximum of dominant follicles (four follicles of a maximum 16 mm diameter). Arcaini 1996 accepted a maximum of six dominant follicles.Four studies did not describe any cancellation criteria. Ten trials reported live birth, our primary outcome of interest. The other studies reported pregnancy as the main outcome.Pregnancy was confirmed by ultrasound in nine trials.In Guzick 1999 pregnancy was confirmed by two hCG measurements or live birth.Others did not report the method of pregnancy confirmation.The reported pregnancies were mostly clinical.The multiple pregnancy rate was mentioned in 13 trials, miscarriage in 11, ectopic pregnancy in 11, and OHSS in 10 trials.These events were o en reported as total numbers or as post-cross-over data and therefore o en could not be used in the meta-analysis. For the 2020 update, we excluded two studies in addition to those previously excluded.One was excluded because it was a prospective cohort study (Van Eekelen 2019) while the other study (Zolghadri 2012) was excluded because it included a mix of women with unexplained infertility and polycystic ovarian syndrome, with no separate data for the two groups.We contacted the study authors for data on women with unexplained infertility but we did not receive any response.We had excluded 23 studies during the previous updates (see details below); we therefore excluded a total of 25 studies from this review update.See Characteristics of excluded studies. For For the 2012 update, 13 studies were excluded (Aboulghar 1993; Doyle 1991; Evans 1991; Gregoriou 1995; Ho 1998; Kirby 1991; Martinez 1990; Martinez 1991; Nulsen 1993; Prentice 1995; Serhal 1988; Tummon 1997; Zikopoulos 1993) .Two studies were found not to be randomised studies (Aboulghar 1993; Serhal 1988) ; inadequate method of randomisation was the reason for exclusion of another two trials (Nulsen 1993; Prentice 1995); one study (Tummon 1997) included women with endometriosis only and thus did not focus on unexplained subfertility; Martinez 1990 reported biochemically-confirmed pregnancies only and was therefore excluded; Ho 1998 did not report separate data for couples with unexplained subfertility; six studies (Doyle 1991; Evans 1991; Gregoriou 1995; Kirby 1991; Martinez 1991; Zikopoulos 1993) reported pre-or post-cross-over \\'per-cycle\\' only, instead of \\'per randomised woman\\', and therefore could not be included.We contacted authors of these studies to obtain relevant data such as pre-cross-over \\'per randomised woman\\' data but we did not receive any response from the authors. There are no studies awaiting classification.However if precross-over data of the excluded studies become available we will reconsider inclusion and report the studies in an update of this review. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Ongoing studies We identified one study which was ongoing and appeared to meet the inclusion criteria (NCT03455426). See the \\'Risk of bias\\' graph (Figure 2 ) and \\'Risk of bias\\' summary (Figure 3 ).Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews In nine of the included studies (Agarwal 2004; Arici 1994; Bhattacharya 2008; Chung 1995; Farquhar 2018; Goverde 2000; Melis 1995; Murdoch 1991; Steures 2006a) , we considered the methods used for sequence generation and allocation concealment to be adequate and we therefore rated them as being at low risk of bias.In the remaining six trials (Arcaini 1996; Crosignani 1991; Deaton 1990; Guzick 1999; Janko 1998; Karlstrom 1993) , the methods used for random sequence generation and allocation concealment were not su iciently described to draw a conclusive judgement, so we rated the risk of bias as unclear. We assessed all the included studies as being at unclear risk for performance bias, as none of them reported blinding due to the nature of the interventions.For detection bias, we rated all the included studies as being at low risk; we considered that nonblinding was unlikely to a ect the outcomes of interest, as they were objectively assessed. We used an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis when possible.In three trials an ITT analysis was not possible (Crosignani 1991; Deaton 1990; Karlstrom 1993) , as the trials only reported the number of participants analysed. In Murdoch 1991 one woman became pregnant spontaneously between treatment cycles.This pregnancy resulted in a live birth and was entered as such in the analysis.Goverde 2000 also reported spontaneous pregnancies that occurred between treatment cycles.Because it was unclear in which group these pregnancies occurred, we could not use them in the ITT analysis. Seven of the 15 included trials clearly mentioned the number of dropouts and the reasons for dropping out (Arici 1994; Deaton 1990; Farquhar 2018; Goverde 2000; Guzick 1999; Melis 1995; Steures 2006a) .Murdoch 1991 reported the number of dropouts but did not give any information on reasons for dropping out.Bhattacharya 2008 had a dropout rate of less than 1%.The studies with the highest dropout rates were Arcaini 1996 (dropout of 20.6%) and Agarwal 2004 (19%).In Agarwal the couples mainly le the study for financial reasons, which resulted in an unevenly-distributed dropout rate of 37% in the treatment group as compared to 1% in the control group.The dropout rate usually increased in studies with a longer follow-up period.Because this review included trials with di erent durations, it was di icult to compare the dropout rates.We rated nine of the included studies as being at low risk of bias, three as unclear and another three as high risk of bias. There was a risk of selective reporting in some of the studies included in this review.Live birth data were not reported in five studies (Arcaini 1996; Crosignani 1991; Deaton 1990; Janko 1998; Karlstrom 1993) .Adverse events were o en not reported by group but as a study total, which could not be included in the analysis.Multiple pregnancy rates were not reported in two trials (Crosignani 1991; Janko 1998) .We rated nine of the included studies as being at low risk of bias, five as being at unclear risk and one as being at high risk.We did not construct a funnel plot for any of the analyses, as none of them included up to 10 studies. To reduce bias introduced by a cross-over study design, we included pre-cross-over data only.Three studies used a cross-over design (Arici 1994; Crosignani 1991; Deaton 1990) .In this design participants were initially randomised to the treatment or control group but then crossed over to the other group a er a certain number of treatment cycles.The duration of these studies varied from two to eight treatment cycles per couple.In two studies (Arici 1994; Crosignani 1991 ) the participants crossed over a er one treatment cycle.In Deaton 1990 participants crossed over a er four cycles. We rated nine of the included studies as being at low risk of bias because baseline demographic characteristics of participants between the two treatment groups were similar.We rated the remaining six studies at unclear risk for this domain because there was insu icient information to make a conclusive judgement on the baseline demographic characteristics of participants.This section describes the results of the meta-analyses and sensitivity analyses. The results from this comparison were all obtained from Bhattacharya 2008.Data for the unexplained subfertility group only were provided by the trial author. Analysis 1.1 It is uncertain whether treatment with IUI in a natural cycle results in a higher cumulative live birth rate compared to treatment with expectant management in a natural cycle (OR 1.60, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.78; 1 RCT, 334 women; low-quality evidence).The evidence suggests that if we assume the chance of a live birth using expectant management to be 16%, that of IUI would be between 15% and 34%. Analysis 1.2 It is uncertain whether treatment with IUI in a natural cycle results in a lower multiple pregnancy rate compared to treatment with expectant management in a natural cycle (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.04 to 5.53; 1 RCT, 334 women; low-quality evidence).The evidence suggests that if we assume the risk of a multiple pregnancy using Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews expectant management to be 1%, the risk using IUI would be between 0% and 6%. We did not perform sensitivity analyses as only one trial with low risk of selection bas was included in the analysis for both primary outcomes. Analysis 1.3 Compared to expectant management in a natural cycle, it is uncertain whether treatment with IUI in a natural cycle results in a higher cumulative pregnancy rate (OR 1.53, 95% CI 0.88 to 2.64; 1 RCT, 334 women; low-quality evidence).The evidence suggests that if we assume the chance of a pregnancy using expectant management to be 16%, that of IUI would be between 15% and 34%. Data on OHSS were not reported. Analysis 1.4 It is uncertain whether treatment with IUI in a natural cycle results in a lower miscarriage rate compared to treatment with expectant management in a natural cycle.Sixteen miscarriages were reported in a total of 334 couples, seven in the IUI group and nine in the expectant management group (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.28 to 2.11; 1 RCT, 334 women; low-quality evidence).The evidence suggests that if we assume the risk of a miscarriage using expectant management to be 5%, that of IUI would be between 2% and 11%. Analysis 1.5 Compared to expectant management in a natural cycle, it is uncertain whether treatment with IUI in a natural cycle results in a lower ectopic pregnancy rate.Two ectopic pregnancies were reported in a total of 334 couples, with both occurring in the IUI group (OR 5.06, 95% CI 0.24 to 106.21; 1 RCT, 334 women; lowquality evidence). Analysis 2.1 Only two of the six trials included in the analysis reported live birth rates (Chung 1995; Melis 1995) .It is uncertain whether treatment with IUI in a stimulated cycle results in a higher cumulative live birth rate compared to treatment with TI in a stimulated cycle (OR 1.59, 95% CI 0.88 to 2.88; 2 RCTs, 208 women; I 2 = 72%; lowquality evidence).The evidence suggests that if we assume the chance of a live birth using TI to be 26%, that of IUI would be between 23% and 50%.Statistical heterogeneity was detected (P = 0.06, I 2 = 72%) between the two studies, with inconsistency in the directions of e ect estimates.This may be explained by the fact that all participants in Melis 1995 had previously received fertility treatment. We did not perform sensitivity analysis excluding studies at unclear or high selection bias as both trials were at low risk of selection bias Analysis 2.2 Four studies reported their multiple pregnancies per treatment arm (Arcaini 1996; Chung 1995; Karlstrom 1993; Melis 1995) , with a total of 17 multiple pregnancies in 316 couples.Arcaini 1996, Chung 1995 and Karlstrom 1993 reported one high-order multiple pregnancy each.The studies reported 11 multiple pregnancies in the IUI group and six in the TI group (representing 13.5% of the total number of pregnancies in these studies).Pooling the data from these studies showed that it is uncertain whether treatment with IUI in a stimulated cycle results in a lower multiple pregnancy rate compared to treatment with TI in a stimulated cycle (OR 1.46, 95% CI 0.55 to 3.87; 4 RCTs, 316 women; I 2 = 0%; low-quality evidence). The evidence suggests that if we assume the risk of a multiple pregnancy using TI to be 4%, the risk using IUI would be between 2% and 15%. Analysis 2.3 Six trials reported pregnancy rates per couple.There were 517 women included in this analysis, reporting 149 cumulative pregnancies.The result showed that treatment with IUI in a stimulated cycle may result in a higher cumulative pregnancy rate compared to treatment with TI in a stimulated cycle (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.53; 6 RCTs, 517 women; I 2 = 8%; low-quality evidence).This suggests that if we assume the chance of a pregnancy with TI to be 23%, the chance of a pregnancy in women using IUI would be between 26% and 44%. Analysis 2.4 One case of OHSS was reported in 36 couples who were treated with IUI, while none was reported in 32 couples who received TI.It is, however, uncertain whether treatment with IUI in a stimulated cycle results in a lower OHSS rate compared to treatment with TI in a stimulated cycle (OR 2.75, 95% CI 0.11 to 69.83; 1 RCT, 68 women; very low-quality evidence). Analysis 2.5 Twenty-seven miscarriages were reported in total.Fi een were reported by treatment arm, nine in the IUI group and six in the TI group.It is uncertain whether treatment with IUI in a stimulated cycle results in a lower miscarriage rate compared to treatment with TI in a stimulated cycle (OR 1.66, 95% CI 0.56 to 4.88; I 2 = 0%; 2 RCTs, 208 women; low-quality evidence).The evidence suggests that if we assume the risk of miscarriage using TI to be 6%, the risk using IUI would be between 3% and 23%. Analysis 2. In couples with a low prediction score of natural conception, treatment with IUI in a stimulated cycle probably results in a higher cumulative live birth rate compared to treatment with expectant management in a natural cycle (OR 4.48, 95% CI 2.00 to 10.01; 1 RCT; 201 women; moderate-quality evidence).The evidence suggests that if we assume the chance of a live birth with expectant management in a natural cycle to be 9%, the chance of a live birth with IUI in a stimulated cycle would be between 17% and 50%. It is uncertain whether treatment with IUI in a stimulated cycle results in a higher cumulative live birth rate compared to treatment with expectant management in a natural cycle (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.49; 1 RCT, 253 women; low-quality evidence).The evidence suggests that if we assume the chance of a live birth with expectant management in a natural cycle to be 24%, the chance of a live birth with IUI in a stimulated cycle would be between 12% and 32%. .The evidence suggests that if we assume the risk of a multiple pregnancy with expectant management in a natural cycle to be 0%, the risk of a multiple pregnancy with IUI in a stimulated cycle would be between 0% and 8%. We did not perform sensitivity analyses excluding studies at unclear or high selection bias, as both trials were at low risk of selection bias for the primary outcomes. Analysis 3.3 Data on this outcome were reported by three studies (Deaton 1990; Farquhar 2018; Steures 2006a) .We did not pool data from the three studies, because of extreme statistical heterogeneity (I 2 = 86%).The presence of significant heterogeneity might be due to the use of di erent population groups and OH drugs by the three studies: Deaton 1990 investigated women with mild or moderate endometriosis, using clomiphene citrate only; Farquhar 2018 investigated women with a low chance of spontaneous conception (prediction score of natural conception less than 30%), using clomiphene citrate or letrozole; Steures 2006a included couples with an intermediate chance of spontaneous conception (prediction score of natural conception between 30% and 40%).using clomiphene citrate or gonadotropins. It is uncertain whether treatment with IUI in a stimulated cycle results in a higher cumulative pregnancy rate compared to treatment with TI in a natural cycle (OR 3.20, 95% CI 0.82 to 12.50; 1 RCT, 51 women; low-quality evidence). Two studies (Deaton 1990; Farquhar 2018) reported on OHSS in this comparison; there were no cases of OHSS in either study. Analysis 3.4 Data on this outcome were reported by Farquhar 2018 and Steures 2006a.Treatment with IUI in a stimulated cycle probably results in a higher miscarriage rate compared to treatment with expectant management in a natural cycle (OR 2.87, 95% CI 1.18 to 7.01; 2 RCTs, 454 women; I 2 = 0%; moderate-quality evidence).The evidence suggests that if we assume the risk of miscarriage with expectant management in a natural cycle to be 3%, the risk of miscarriage with IUI in a stimulated cycle would be between 4% and 18%. Analysis 4.1 Treatment with IUI in a natural cycle probably results in a higher cumulative live birth rate compared to expectant management in a stimulated cycle (OR 1.95, 95% CI 1.10 to 3.44; 1 RCT, 342 women: moderate-quality evidence).The evidence suggests that if we assume the chance of a live birth with expectant management in a stimulated cycle to be 13%, the chance of a live birth with IUI in a natural cycle would be between 14% and 34%. Analysis 4.2 It is uncertain whether treatment with IUI in a natural cycle results in a lower multiple pregnancy rate compared to treatment with expectant management in a stimulated cycle (OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.07 to 16.90; 1 RCT, 342 women; low-quality evidence).The evidence suggests that if we assume the risk of a multiple pregnancy in expectant management in a stimulated cycle to be 1%, the risk of a multiple pregnancy with IUI in a natural cycle would be between 0% and 9%. We did not perform sensitivity analysis for the main outcomes, as we included only one study with low risk of selection bias in this comparison. Treatment with IUI in a natural cycle probably results in a higher cumulative pregnancy rate compared to treatment with expectant management in a stimulated cycle (OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.01 to 3.08; 1 RCT, 342 women; moderate-quality evidence).The evidence suggests that if we assume the chance of a pregnancy with expectant management in a stimulated cycle to be 14%, the chance of a pregnancy with IUI in a natural cycle would be between 14% and 34%. OHSS was not reported. Analysis 4.4 It is uncertain whether treatment with IUI in a natural cycle results in a lower miscarriage rate compared to treatment with expectant management in a stimulated cycle (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.32 to 2.58; 1 RCT, 342 women; low-quality evidence).The evidence suggests that if we assume the risk of a miscarriage with expectant management in a stimulated cycle to be 5%, the risk of a miscarriage with IUI in a natural cycle would be between 2% and 11%. Analysis 4.5 Although two ectopic pregnancies occurred in the IUI group, it is uncertain whether treatment with IUI in a natural cycle results in a lower ectopic pregnancy rate compared to treatment with expectant management in a stimulated cycle (OR 5.30, 95% CI 0.25 to 111.26; 1 RCT, 342 women; low-quality evidence). Analysis 5. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews women; low-quality evidence).The evidence suggests that if we assume the chance of a live birth with IUI in a natural cycle to be 14%, the chance of a live birth with IUI in a stimulated cycle would be between 17% and 36%.In a sensitivity analysis, we obtained a similar result by excluding Arici 1994, a cross-over trial (OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.18 to 3.45; I 2 = 0%; 3 RCTs, 370 women); however, it is uncertain whether treatment with IUI in a stimulated cycle results in a higher cumulative live birth rate compared to treatment with IUI in a natural cycle when we excluded Guzick 1999, a study with unclear risk of bias for random sequence generation and allocation concealment (OR 1.69, 95% CI 0.83 to 3.44; I 2 = 0%; 3 RCTs, 185 women). Analysis 5.2 It is uncertain whether treatment with IUI in a stimulated cycle results in a higher multiple pregnancy rate compared to treatment with IUI in a natural cycle (OR 3.00, 95% CI 0.11 to 78.27; 1 RCT, 39; women; low-quality evidence) (Figure 5 ). Analysis 5.3 It is uncertain whether treatment with IUI in a stimulated cycle results in a higher cumulative pregnancy rate compared to treatment with IUI in a natural cycle (OR 6.43, 95% CI 0.56 to 73.35; 1 RCT, 26 women; low-quality evidence).The evidence suggests that if we assume the chance of a pregnancy with IUI in a natural cycle to be 6%, the chance of a pregnancy with IUI in a stimulated cycle would be between 4% and 83%. There were no reported cases of OHSS. Analysis 5.4 One miscarriage in the stimulated group was reported by Arici 1994.Guzick 1999 reported a total miscarriage rate of approximately 24% in all couples undergoing IUI treatment.It is uncertain whether treatment with IUI in a stimulated cycle results in a higher miscarriage rate compared to treatment with IUI in a natural cycle (OR 5.21, 95% CI 0.19 to 141.08; 1 RCT, 26 women; low-quality evidence). Analysis 5.5 It is uncertain whether treatment with IUI in a stimulated cycle results in a higher ectopic pregnancy rate compared to treatment with IUI in a natural cycle (OR 6.48, 95% CI 0.33 to 127.09; 1 RCTs, 211 women; very low-quality evidence). This is an update of a Cochrane Review which assessed whether the live birth rate is improved with intrauterine insemination (IUI), with or without ovarian hyperstimulation (OH), compared to timed intercourse (TI) or expectant management with or without OH, or with IUI with OH compared to IUI in a natural cycle, for couples with unexplained subfertility.Fi een studies met the eligibility criteria for inclusion; they investigated di erent IUI treatment modalities in five comparisons involving a total of 2068 women.Primary outcomes reported were cumulative live birth rates and multiple pregnancy rates.Secondary outcomes reported were cumulative pregnancy rates and other adverse events, including moderate to severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) rates, miscarriage rates, and ectopic pregnancy rates.The five comparisons identified in the included studies are classified into two broad groups as follows: We identified four comparisons in this group: 1. IUI in a natural cycle versus TI or expectant management in a natural cycle; 2. IUI in a stimulated cycle versus TI or expectant management in a stimulated cycle; 3. IUI in a stimulated cycle versus TI or expectant management in a natural cycle; and 4. IUI in a natural cycle versus TI or expectant management in a stimulated cycle. For live birth, it is uncertain whether treatment with IUI in a natural cycle results in a higher cumulative live birth rate compared to treatment with expectant management in a natural cycle.We obtained a similar result with treatment with IUI in a stimulated cycle compared to TI in a stimulated cycle.However, there is Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews moderate-quality evidence that treatment with IUI in a stimulated cycle is likely to result in a higher cumulative live birth rate compared to treatment with expectant management in a natural cycle in couples with a low prediction score of natural conception. The evidence suggests that if we assume the chance of a live birth with expectant management in a natural cycle to be 9%, the chance of a live birth with IUI in a stimulated cycle would be between 17% and 50%.Similarly, there is moderate-quality evidence that treatment with IUI in a natural cycle is likely to result in a higher cumulative live birth rate compared to expectant management in a stimulated cycle.The evidence suggests that if we assume the chance of a live birth with expectant management in a stimulated cycle to be 13%, the chance of a live birth with IUI in a natural cycle would be between 14% and 34%. For multiple pregnancy, it is uncertain whether treatment with IUI with or without OH results in lower multiple pregnancy rates compared to treatment with TI or expectant management, with or without OH.For other adverse events such as OHSS rates, miscarriage rates and ectopic pregnancy rates, there were insu icient data to adequately assess the impact of these treatment modalities; data on these outcomes were either not reported or reported in single studies with small sample sizes. For live birth, there is low-quality evidence that treatment with IUI in a stimulated cycle may result in a higher cumulative live birth rate compared to treatment with IUI in a natural cycle.The evidence suggests that if we assume the chance of a live birth with IUI in a natural cycle to be 14%, the chance of a live birth with IUI in a stimulated cycle would be between 17% and 36%.We tested the robustness of this finding in a sensitivity analysis by excluding a study with unclear risk of bias for random sequence generation and allocation concealment; the result showed that without this trial there was probably little or no di erence in live birth rates between the two treatment groups. For multiple pregnancy, it is uncertain whether treatment with IUI in a stimulated cycle results in a lower multiple pregnancy rate compared with treatment with IUI in a natural cycle.For other adverse events such as OHSS rates, miscarriage rates and ectopic pregnancy rates, there were insu icient data to adequately assess the impact of this treatment modality; data on these outcomes were mostly reported in single studies with small sample sizes. Most of the comparisons identified in this review were investigated in single trials, thereby making it di icult to combine data in metaanalyses.Where we could pool data in meta-analyses, the overall e ect estimates usually had wide confidence intervals due to small sample sizes with low numbers of events.Furthermore, we were not able to assess all the stipulated outcomes for each comparison.There were not enough data available to adequately assess the e ects of the various interventions on live birth, multiple pregnancy and other adverse events.Many studies were not included in the review as they reported per-cycle data only.One of the areas of particular concern in fertility trials is what statisticians refer to as the \\'unit of analysis\\' error (Vail 2003) .It is methodologically incorrect to report data per cycle when it is women or couples who are randomised, because many of the women would have undergone more than one treatment cycle (Dias 2008; Johnson 2003; Vail 2003 ).Yet pregnancy rate per cycle is a commonlyreported outcome in fertility trials and reviews.We could also not include many studies with a cross-over design in the review because they did not report pre-cross-over data.We could not include post-cross-over data because couples would have received both treatment modalities.There have been many discussions about whether a cross-over design is appropriate for fertility trials, mainly because participants drop out a er treatment success, which results in a selected participant population post-cross-over. For this reason, it has been suggested that the cross-over design has no place in infertility trials (Daya 1993) .A cross-over design could result in an overestimation of the treatment e ect (Khan 1996; Norman 2000) .Whether this overestimation could be statistically corrected for or whether it is clinically relevant remains under debate (Cohlen 1998; McDonnell 2004; Vail 2003) . Adverse events were o en not mentioned, or mentioned by group instead of by treatment modality.We included studies mentioning \\'no events\\' in the meta-analyses, which might result in underestimation of the adverse events.On the other hand, these adverse events are mostly attributed to OH and not to IUI.It seems therefore unlikely that any significant di erence in adverse events would be found when OH with TI is compared to OH with IUI.We could not determine the separate evidence for the number of treatment cycles and methods of ovarian hyperstimulation, due to insu icient studies.In addition, we did not examine the e ects of important prognostic factors such as age, duration of subfertility and previous treatment in subgroup analyses, although there would have been insu icient data to do these analyses if we had decided to do so.The extent to which some of the findings which show evidence of a di erence between the intervention groups are applicable to couples with di erent prognoses and baseline fecundity is therefore unclear. The more recent studies adopted expectant management as a control treatment for IUI instead of timed intercourse (Bhattacharya 2008; Farquhar 2018; Steures 2006a) .Because timing of intercourse (TI) interferes with the natural coital habits of a couple, expectant management has been proposed as the more appropriate comparison treatment for IUI (Wilcox 1995) .A recent meta-analysis, however, shows no significant di erence in the pregnancy rate between studies comparing IUI versus TI and studies with IUI versus expectant management (Snick 2008) . Whether it is appropriate to pool studies including TI and expectant management in a meta-analysis remains unclear.We did not, however, pool the data from Bhattacharya 2008, Farquhar 2018 and Steures 2006a with data of trials applying TI because these trials comprised comparisons that were not subject to many other trials. Most of the studies included in this review were of moderatelygood quality in relation to risk of bias.We excluded studies with a cross-over design which did not report pre-cross-over data. Most of the included studies clearly described their methods of sequence generation and allocation concealment.None of the included studies reported blinding, due to the nature of the interventions; however, lack of blinding may not have any e ect on the outcomes of interest, as they were objectively assessed.For most comparisons, e ect estimates were associated with imprecision due to small sample sizes and wide confidence intervals.We assessed the quality of the evidence for the review\\'s five comparisons; the quality of the evidence for our primary Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews outcomes (cumulative live birth and multiple pregnancy) ranged from low to moderate.The main limitations in the body of evidence were very serious imprecision due to small sample sizes with low event rates and e ect estimates with wide confidence intervals, and inadequate reporting of adverse events.We could not examine the presence of publication or reporting bias in funnel plots for any of the comparisons, as none of the analyses included 10 or more studies.We therefore did not downgrade the quality of the evidence for publication bias. To prevent selection bias, the included studies were independently selected and data extracted by two review authors (ROA and SVV for the 2020 update).We resolved disagreements by discussion, keeping the protocol as our guideline to reduce bias.We consulted a statistician (Andy Vail) for the data extraction of complicated cross-over trials.We have extracted and calculated the events per randomised couple for this meta-analysis, which resulted in the exclusion of six studies reporting only post-cross-over or percycle data.As a consequence, the analysis is statistically less biased, although a selection bias may have occurred.We could not construct a funnel plot for any of the outcomes to check for the presence of publication bias as none of the outcomes was reported by 10 or more studies.We have, however, minimised the e ect of publication bias by undertaking a comprehensive search for all eligible studies. Previous review articles and meta-analyses (e.g. Aboulghar 2003; Balasch 2004; Cohlen 2005; Costello 2004; Hughes 1997; Zeyneloglu 1998 ) have all assessed the e ectiveness of IUI and ovarian hyperstimulation, but they have all calculated pregnancy rates per cycle, which makes it di icult to compare their findings with those of this review which included per-couple data only.Percycle data produce biased results that may exaggerate treatment results (Dias 2008) .A Cochrane Review and meta-analysis published in 2019 (Wang 2019) evaluated the e ectiveness and safety of di erent approaches to clinical management (expectant management, ovarian stimulation, intra-uterine insemination, ovarian stimulation-intra-uterine insemination, and in vitrofertilisation/intracytoplasmic sperm injection) in couples with unexplained infertility.There was insu icient evidence of di erences in live births between intra-uterine insemination or ovarian stimulation-intra-uterine insemination compared to expectant management (OR 1.21, 95% CI 0.61 to 2.43; low-certainty evidence; OR 1.61, 95% CI 0.88 to 2.94; low-certainty evidence respectively).These findings are similar to our findings on live births in the corresponding comparisons in our review. Due to insu icient data, it is uncertain whether treatment with IUI with or without OH compared to timed intercourse or expectant management with or without OH, or treatment with IUI with OH compared to IUI in a natural cycle, improves cumulative live birth rates with acceptable multiple pregnancy rates in couples with unexplained subfertility.However, there is moderatequality evidence that treatment with IUI with OH probably results in a higher cumulative live birth rate compared to expectant management, without OH in couples with a low prediction score of natural conception.Similarly, there is moderate-quality evidence that treatment with IUI in a natural cycle probably results in a higher cumulative live birth rate compared to treatment with timed intercourse with OH. None of the comparisons examined in this review were adequately addressed, due to insu icient data; questions still remain as to whether live birth rates can be improved while keeping the risk of multiple pregnancy and other adverse events to acceptable levels.There is therefore a need for better-designed randomised controlled trials which evaluate the e ects of di erent IUI modalities on important outcome measures.Furthermore, future trials should endeavour to report live birth and other outcome data in forms which enable appropriate analyses.

To assess the e ectiveness and acceptability of non-invasive positive airway pressure therapy for improving erectile dysfunction in OSAS. We identified studies from the Cochrane Airways Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, AMED EBSCO, and LILACS, the US National Institutes of Health ongoing trials register ClinicalTrials.gov,and the World Health Organisation international clinical trials registry platform to 14 June 2021, with no restriction on date, language, or status of publication.We checked the reference lists of all primary studies, and review articles for additional references, and relevant manufacturers\\' websites for study information.We also searched specific conference proceedings for the British Association of Urological Surgeons; the European Association of Urology; and the American Urological Association to 14 June 2021. We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a parallel or cross-over design, or cluster-RCTs, which included men aged 18 years or older, with OSAS and ED.We considered RCTs comparing any non-invasive positive airway pressure therapy (such as continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP), bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), variable positive airway pressure (VPAP), or similar devices) versus sham, no treatment, waiting list, or pharmacological treatment for ED.The primary outcomes were remission of ED and serious adverse events; secondary outcome were sex-related quality of life, health-related quality of life, and minor adverse events. Two review authors independently conducted study selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment.A third review author solved any disagreement.We used the Cochrane RoB 1 tool to assess the risk of bias of the included RCTs.We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the body of evidence.To measure the treatment e ect on dichotomous outcomes, we used the risk ratio (RR); for continuous outcomes, we used the mean di erence (MD).We calculated 95% confidence intervals (CI) for these measures.When possible (data availability and homogeneous studies), we used a random-e ect model to pool data with a meta-analysis. We included six RCTs (all assessing CPAP as the non-invasive positive airway pressure therapy device), with a total of 315 men with OSAS and ED.All RCTs presented some important risk of bias related to selection, performance, assessment, or reporting bias.None of included RCTs assessed the ED remission rate, and we used the provided ED mean scores as a proxy. There is uncertainty about the e ect of CPAP on mean ED scores a er 4 weeks, using the International index of erectile function (IIEF-5, higher = better; MD 7.50, 95% CI 4.05 to 10.95; 1 RCT; 27 participants; very low-certainty evidence), and a er 12 weeks (IIEF-ED, ED domain; MD 2.50, 95% CI -1.10 to 6.10; 1 RCT; 57 participants; very low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to methodological limitations and imprecision).There is uncertainty about the e ect of CPAP on sex-related quality of life a er 12 weeks, using the Self-esteem and relationship test (SEAR, higher = better; MD 1.00, 95% CI -8.09 to 10.09; 1 RCT; 57 participants; very low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to methodological limitations and imprecision); no serious adverse events were reported a er 4 weeks (1 RCT; 27 participants; very low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to methodological limitations and imprecision). One RCT assessed this comparison (61 participants), but we were unable to extract outcomes for this comparison due to the factorial design and reporting of this trial. Sildenafil may slightly improve erectile function at 12 weeks when compared to CPAP, measured with the IIEF-ED (MD -4.78, 95% CI -6.98 to -2.58; 3 RCTs; 152 participants; I = 59%; low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to methodological limitations). There is uncertainty about the e ect of CPAP on sex-related quality of life a er 12 weeks, measured with the Erectile Dysfunction Inventory of Treatment Satisfaction questionnaire (EDITS, higher = better; MD -1.24, 95% CI -1.80 to -0.67; 2 RCTs; 122 participants; I = 0%; very low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to methodological limitations).No serious adverse events were reported for either group (2 RCTs; 70 participants; very low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to methodological limitations and imprecision).There is uncertainty about the e ects of CPAP when compared to sildenafil for the incidence of minor adverse events (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.34 to 5.21; 1 RCT; 40 participants; very low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to methodological limitations and imprecision).The confidence interval was wide and neither a significant increase nor reduction in the risk of minor adverse events can be ruled out with the use of CPAP (4/20 men complained of nasal dryness in the CPAP group, and 3/20 men complained of transient flushing and mild headache in the sildenafil group). When compared with no CPAP, we are uncertain about the e ectiveness and acceptability of CPAP for improving erectile dysfunction in men with obstructive sleep apnoea.When compared with sildenafil, there is some evidence that sildenafil may slightly improve erectile function at 12 weeks. The purpose of this review was to assess the e ectiveness and acceptability of non-invasive positive airway pressure therapy for improving erectile dysfunction (ED) in men with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSAS). OSAS is a clinical condition in which repeated throat obstructions occur during sleep, leading to pauses in breathing.Erectile dysfunction is the inability of a man to achieve and maintain a su icient erection to allow satisfactory sexual activity.The association of OSAS and ED is far more common than might be found by chance. Non-invasive positive airway pressure therapy is a device that is attached to a mask that delivers oxygen.The device helps air enter the airways and help breathing.There are a few di erent types of devices including continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), bilevel The mean erectile dysfunction score with CPAP device was 2.5 points higher (1.1 lower to 6.We are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect.Moderate certainty.We are moderately confident in the effect estimate; the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different.Low certainty.Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited; the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.Very low certainty, We have very little confidence in the effect estimate; the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect. a High risk of bias for blinding participants, personal, outcome assessment; we downgraded two levels (-2).b No events were reported.c Small sample size; we downgraded one level (-1), d Wide 95% CI, including null e ect; we downgraded two levels (-2). Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) is characterised by recurrent occlusion of the pharyngeal airway space (respiratory tract) during sleep (Eckert 2008) .OSAS is caused by a combination of factors, namely: obesity, increased upper airway resistance, craniofacial abnormalities, and failure of the dilator action of pharyngeal muscle (Eckert 2008) .OSAS is a highly prevalent condition, a ecting 14% of men and 5% of women (Peppard 2013) (the result of release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from immunerelated cells and the activation of the innate immune system), and increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system (Arnardottir 2009) .These mechanisms culminate in endothelial dysfunction (diminished production or availability of nitric oxide, or imbalance in the relative contribution of endothelium-derived relaxing and contracting factor, or both), and structural changes in vessels (Gunnarsson 2014) .As a consequence of this, OSAS leads to increase cardiovascular (Young 2008), and all-cause mortality (Marshall 2008; Wolf 2007) . Erectile dysfunction (ED) is defined by the persistent inability to achieve and maintain an erection su icient to permit satisfactory intercourse (APA 2013).Erectile dysfunction may result from one or more of the following aetiologies: psychological, neurologic, hormonal, arterial, and venous.ED can be classified as psychogenic, iatrogenic (injury or adverse e ect caused by the treatment), and organic (APA 2013; Muneer 2014; Shamloul 2013) .Organic impotence refers to the inability to obtain an erection firm enough for penetration, or the inability to sustain the erection until completion of intercourse.In contrast to psychogenic impotence (which is impotence caused by anxiety, guilt, depression, or conflict around various sexual issues), organic impotence, the more common of the three categories of erectile dysfunction, is caused by physical problems (Ende 1990) .ED is the most common cause of sexual dissatisfaction, a ecting up to 20% of men at all ages, and 50% to 60% of older men (Holden 2005; Rosen 2004 ).Psychological factors may influence ED, but an organic cause is identified in the majority of cases.Organic ED represents 60% to 80% of all cases, and is associated with systemic diseases, such as hypertension and diabetes (Lue 2000) . The association of OSAS and ED is far more common than might be found by chance (Andersen 2010).The joint prevalence rate is estimated to be in the range of 30% to 70% (Santos 2012; Se el 2002) .OSAS severity, particularly when determined by the level of hypoxaemia, predicts the presence of erectile dysfunction (Shin 2008) .Both diseases are associated with chronic comorbidities, such as hypertension and diabetes, and share several risk factors in common, such as age and obesity.However, OSAS remains an independent predictor of ED in adjusted models, suggesting a causal relationship (Budweiser 2013) . Non-invasive positive airway pressure therapy consists of the application of positive pressure in the airways, through a nasal or oronasal mask, to prevent the collapse of pharyngeal so tissues during sleep; it is associated with improved sleep, reduced excessive daytime sleepiness, and improved cognitive function (Jonas 2017; Jordan 2014) . Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is a non-invasive positive airway pressure device that is widely recognised as the first-line treatment for OSAS, due to its e ectiveness in reducing both the apnoea/hypopnoea index (AHI) and excessive daytime sleepiness (ESS), although low rates of adherence to CPAP are commonly observed in the long term (Epstein 2009; Giles 2006) .Non-adherence rates remain in the range of 30% to 40%, despite the technological advances in developing more comfortable interfaces and machines made by the industry (Rotenberg 2016) .Currently, there is no unequivocal recommendation about how many hours of CPAP is needed per night to improve symptoms related to OSAS, but a range of four to six hours has been suggested for di erent clinical outcomes (Weaver 2007). To date, the literature has failed to demonstrate e ectiveness of CPAP on cardiovascular outcomes, but there is uncertainty for ED outcomes, perhaps due to the multiple potential mechanisms of action of CPAP on ED (Qiu 2017) . One meta-analysis evaluated the e ect of CPAP on endothelial function in participants with OSAS (Xu 2015).A randome ects model found that CPAP significantly improved endothelial function, assessed by flow-mediated dilation (widening of an artery when blood flow increases in that artery), but there was no significant improvement in endothelial function in response to nitroglycerin-mediated dilation (organic nitrate with vasodilator activity).Sensitivity analyses indicated that the protective e ect of CPAP on endothelial function was robust.CPAP significantly improved flow-mediated dilatation in participants with OSAS (Xu 2015). Besides CPAP device, there are other devices available for noninvasive airways pressure therapy, as bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) and variable positive airway pressure (VPAP), with similar mechanisms, that could be analysed. From the mechanistic perspective, the endothelial dysfunction caused by oxidative stress in people with OSAS may be the cause of the high prevalence rates of both OSAS and ED (Hoyos 2015) . It has been clearly demonstrated that OSAS causes endothelial dysfunction, which in turn is a root cause of ED.Endothelial dysfunction reduces the secretion of nitric oxide, leading to impaired relaxation of smooth muscles, and consequently, to inadequate vasodilatation and lack of blood flow to the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews corpora cavernous.Other mechanisms have also been implied, such as sympathetic activation, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep fragmentation, hormonal deficiency, and mood disorders (Jeon 2015; Luboshitzky 2002) .Non-invasive positive airway pressure therapy reverses sleep fragmentation and intermittent hypoxaemia, which reduces oxidative stress (Alonso-Fernandez 2009), and also improves endothelial function (Schwarz 2015; Somers 1995) .Therefore, this therapy leads to the improvement of intermediate mechanisms, which might contribute to ED in people with OSAS. Erectile dysfunction impairs quality of life by compromising selfesteem, and by promoting emotional and relationship tension (Althof 2002) .OSAS also impacts negatively on quality of life, due to its neuropsychiatric symptoms, cognitive dysfunction, and disruption of professional and social life.Both conditions are highly prevalent in the general population (Feldman 1994; Pastore 2014 ). Continuous positive airway pressure therapy is e ective in improving excessive daytime sleepiness (McDaid 2009 ), yet it is still not clear to what extent CPAP is capable of improving ED in people with OSAS, or whether it is more e ective than standard pharmacological treatment of ED (Dong 2010; Khafagy 2012) . With the answer to this debate, the practical recommendations for approaching ED in OSAS might di er from the approach of ED in the general population.Whilst pharmacological treatment of ED with oral phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors is generally considered safe and e ective (Goldstein 2016) , some potentially harmful side e ects have been reported (Galvez-Ruiz 2013). This Cochrane Review is important, as it will systematically evaluate the e ectiveness of non-invasive positive airway pressure therapy in improving ED, and other important clinical outcomes, such as quality of life, in men with OSAS. To assess the e ectiveness and acceptability of non-invasive positive airway pressure for improving erectile dysfunction in obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome. We sought randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a parallel or cross-over design, and cluster-RCTs.We included studies reported in full text, those published as an abstract only, and unpublished data.We included studies regardless of the date or language of publication. We considered studies with men, aged 18 years or older, with obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) and erectile dysfunction (ED). OSAS was defined by the occurrence of daytime sleepiness, loud snoring, witnessed breathing interruptions, or awakenings due to gasping or choking, in the presence of at least five obstructive respiratory events per hour of sleep (apnoeas, hypopnoeas, or respiratory e ort-related arousals), or alternatively, by the presence of 15 or more obstructive respiratory events per hour of sleep, even in the absence of clinical symptomatology (American Academy of Sleep Medicine 2014). ED was defined by meeting criteria from one of these sources: • If any other validated diagnostic criteria were used, we also considered them for this review. We investigated the following interventions and comparators.We included studies with any co-intervention, provided both groups (intervention and control) received the same cointervention, in the same way, so that the possible di erence in results was the e ect of the non-invasive positive airway pressure therapy. The minimum duration of intervention was one month.We considered any length of follow-up. • Sex-related quality of life • Health-related quality of life • Minor adverse events Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) and the International Index of Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5 (Rosen 1999) ). For the standard formal IIEF questionnaire, remission is defined as a score of 19 or more out of 30 points; for the IIEF-5 questionnaire, it is a score of 17 or more out of 25 points (Rosen 1999) .A brief explanation of each tool is presented in Appendix 1. • Serious adverse events: proportion of men with at least one serious adverse event related to CPAP use, such as pneumothorax, impairment of cardiac function in men with heart failure. 2000) ). • Minor adverse events: proportion of men with at least one minor adverse event (e.g.local allergy, local injury, nasal dryness). We analysed and extracted all outcomes at short-, intermediateand long-term follow-up. • Short-term: from 4 weeks to less than 12 weeks • Intermediate-term: from 12 weeks to less than 24 weeks • Long-term: 24 weeks or more If a study reported outcomes at multiple time points within the same period (as listed above), we used the last reported measurement. We included eligible studies regardless of whether they reported an outcome of interest in this review. We identified studies from searches of the following databases and trial registries: We searched all sources from inception, with no restriction on language of publication.The database search strategies are listed in Appendix 2. The Cochrane Airways Information Specialist developed the search strategy in collaboration with the review authors. We checked the reference lists of all primary studies included and of review articles (that were found during the selection process) for additional references.We searched relevant manufacturers\\' websites for study information.We also searched specific conference proceedings for the British Association of Urological Surgeons (BAUS); European Association of Urology (EAU); and American Urological Association (AUA), searched 14 June 2021. We searched for errata or retractions from included studies published in full text on PubMed on 14 June 2021. Two review authors (FTB, LESF, or MPS) independently screened the titles and abstracts of the search results, and coded them as \\'retrieve\\' (eligible or potentially eligible, or unclear), or \\'do not retrieve\\'.We retrieved the full-text study reports of all potentially eligible studies, and two review authors (FTB, LESF or MPS) independently screened them for inclusion, recording the reasons for exclusion of ineligible studies.We resolved any disagreement through discussion, or if was required, we consulted a third review author (RR).We identified and excluded duplicates, and collated multiple reports of the same study, so that each study, rather than each report, was the unit of interest in the review.We recorded the selection process in su icient detail to complete a PRISMA flow diagram and \\'Characteristics of excluded studies\\' table (Moher 2009 ; Figure 1 ). We used a standard data collection form for study characteristics and outcome data, which had been piloted on at least one study in the review, and contained the following characteristics from included studies. • Methods: study design, total duration of study, details of any \\'run-in\\' period, number of study centres and location, study setting, withdrawals, and date of study If necessary (data were lacking), we contacted the authors of included trials by email to request further information.We presented the results of these communications in Appendix 3. If there were duplicate publications, companion documents, or multiple reports for a single primary study, we gathered all the available data by collating them in a single data extraction form.We inserted all additional publications under the main study identification of the included or excluded trial. If results of included trials were available in a trial register database, we collated this information in the appropriate data extraction form.If an included trial was marked as complete in a trial register database, but no additional information (results, or reporting, or both) was available, we planned to assign this trial to \\'Studies awaiting classification\\'. Two review authors (FTB, DVP) independently assessed risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2020) .We resolved any disagreements by discussion, or by involving another review author (RR).We assessed the risk of bias according to the following domains: • Random sequence generation; • Allocation concealment; • Blinding of participants and personnel; • Blinding of outcome assessment; • Incomplete outcome data; • Selective outcome reporting; • Other bias. We judged each potential source of bias as high, low, or unclear, and provided a quote from the study report, together with a justification for our judgement in the risk of bias table.We summarised the risk of bias judgements across di erent studies for each of the domains listed.We considered blinding and incomplete outcome data separately for di erent outcomes.Where information on risk of bias was related to unpublished data or correspondence with a trialist, we noted this in the risk of bias tables. When considering treatment e ects, we took into account the risk of bias for the studies that contributed to that outcome. We conducted the review according to published protocol (Silva 2018) and justified any deviations from it in the \\'Di erences between protocol and review\\' section of the systematic review. We analysed dichotomous data as risk ratio (RR) when the number of men experiencing a specified outcome, or when healthrelated and sex-related quality of life outcomes were presented as dichotomous data (using a cut-o adopted by the trial authors, and based on the literature).For continuous data (health-related and sex-related quality of life), we used the mean di erence (MD), or standardised mean di erence (SMD, when di erent scales were used for the same outcome across the pooled studies).If data from rating scales were combined in a meta-analysis, we ensured they were entered with a consistent direction of e ect (e.g.lower scores always indicated improvement). We undertook meta-analyses only when this was meaningful; that was, if the treatments, participants, and the underlying clinical question were similar enough for pooling to make sense. We described skewed data narratively (for example, as medians and interquartile ranges for each group). When multiple trial arms were reported in a single study, we included only the relevant arms.When two comparisons (e.g.CPAP regimen A versus placebo, and CPAP regimen B versus placebo) were combined in the same meta-analysis, we either combined the active arms, or halved the control group to avoid double-counting. If adjusted analyses were available (ANOVA or ANCOVA), we used these as a preference in our meta-analyses. In the case of cross-over trials, we planned to use only results from the first treatment phase to avoid any carry-over e ect.For cluster-RCTs, we planned to calculate the design e ect using the intra cluster correlation coe icient (ICC). We used intention-to-treat (ITT) or \\'full analysis set\\' analyses when they were reported (i.e. when data were imputed for participants who were randomly assigned but did not complete the study), instead of complete or \\'per protocol\\' analyses. For dichotomous outcomes, we used participants, rather than events, as the unit of analysis (i.e.number of participants presenting with at least one serious adverse events, rather than Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews the number of serious adverse events).However, if rate ratios were reported in a study, we analysed them on this basis.We only planned to meta-analyse data from cluster-RCTs if the available data were adjusted (or could be adjusted), to account for the clustering. We contacted investigators or study sponsors to verify key study characteristics and obtain missing numerical outcome data, when possible (e.g. when a study was identified as an abstract only).When this was not possible, and the missing data were thought to introduce serious bias, we took this into consideration in the GRADE rating for a ected outcomes, and in our judgement of risk of bias. We investigated clinical, methodological, and statistical heterogeneity among included trials.We did not pool e ect estimates in a meta-analysis if we identified substantial clinical or methodological heterogeneity among included studies.We identified statistical heterogeneity by visual inspection of the forest plots, and by using a standard Chi test (significance level of 0.1).We quantified this heterogeneity by using the I statistic; an I statistic of 50% or more indicated substantial heterogeneity (Higgins 2020 ).When we found substantial heterogeneity, we attempted to determine possible reasons for it by individually exploring the trials included in the meta-analysis, and by performing subgroup analyses. We planned to create funnel plots to explore possible publication biases for meta-analysis with 10 or more studies.We did not investigate publication bias because of the low number of RCTs included in the meta-analysis. We used a random-e ects model for meta-analysis, and performed a sensitivity analysis with a fixed-e ect model.When we considered meta-analysis to be inappropriate, we provided a narrative description of the study results. We planned the following subgroup analyses for the primary outcomes. • Partial versus complete adherence.We defined complete adherence as a mean of four or more hours of non-invasive positive airway pressure device use per night, for at least one month, at any pressure level and, with any brand (Antic 2011; Sawyer 2011; Weaver 2007; Zimmerman 2006).We expected better results for men with complete adherence.• Obese versus non-obese participants.We defined obesity as body mass index (BMI) greater than 30.We expected better results for non-obese participants.• Older participants (60 years or older) versus younger participants (younger than 60 years).We expected better results for younger participants.• Di erences between CPAP, BIPAP, VPAP, or similar devices. We planned to use the formal test for subgroup interactions available in Review Manager 5 (RevMan Web 2020). We did not conduct any subgroup analyses because of the scarcity of studies included in each meta-analysis. We planned to carry out sensitivity analyses by removing trials with high risk of bias (those classified as having high risk of bias in at least one of the following domains: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, and blinding) from the primary outcome analyses. We planned to test the robustness of results by repeating the analyses using a fixed-e ect model. We created a summary of findings table, using all primary and secondary outcomes.We used the five GRADE considerations (risk of bias, consistency of e ect, imprecision, indirectness, and publication bias) to assess the certainty of the body of evidence as it related to the studies that contributed data for each prespecified outcome.We used the methods and recommendations described in Section 8.5 and Chapter 12 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2020) , and GRADEpro GDT so ware (GRADEpro GDT).We used footnotes to justify all decisions to downgrade our assessments of the certainty of evidence, and we made comments to aid the reader\\'s understanding of the review where necessary. Two review authors (FTB, RR) independently rated the certainty of evidence for each outcome as high, moderate, low, or very low; discrepancies were resolved by a third author (LESF). We summarised the characteristics of participants, interventions, and outcomes of the included studies in the Characteristics of included studies table. The search strategy retrieved 529 records (up to 14 June 2021).A er removing duplicates, two review authors (FTB, LESF, or MPS) independently screened the titles and abstracts of 365 records, excluded 345 records, and selected 20 for full-text assessment.We excluded four (Hoekema 2007; Karkoulias 2006; Perimenis 2007a; Taskin 2010) .We included six studies, reported in 16 records (Li 2004; Melehan 2018; Pascual 2018; Pastore 2014; Perimenis 2004; Perimenis 2007) .Figure 1 presents the process of study selection. The included trials were published between 2004 and 2018. Five studies were single-centre randomised clinical trials (RCT) with a parallel-group design.They were conducted in China (Li 2004 ), Spain (Pastore 2014), Italy ( Pascual 2018), and Greece (Perimenis 2004; Perimenis 2007).One RCT was a multicentric two by two factorial parallel-group trial, conducted in two Australian centres (Sydney and Clayton (Melehan 2018)). Overall, 315 participants with obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) and erectile dysfunction (ED) were randomised of whom 297 (94%) had their data analysed.The sample size of RCTs ranged from 27 (Li 2004 ) to 82 (Pastore 2014). The mean age of participants ranged from 39.8 years (Li 2004 ), to 56.1 years (Perimenis 2004).The participants presented with mild OSAS in two RCTs (Perimenis 2004; Perimenis 2007) , moderate to severe in three RCTs (Li 2004; Melehan 2018; Pascual 2018) , and severe in one RCT (Pastore 2014). The RCTs compared CPAP with no CPAP (Li 2004  The RCTs addressed the following outcomes of interest for this review: • We did not identify any ongoing studies. We excluded four studies because they used the wrong comparisons (Hoekema 2007; Karkoulias 2006; Perimenis 2007a; Taskin 2010); see Characteristics of excluded studies for details. We assessed the risk of bias in the included RCTs with the Cochrane ROB 1 tool, and classified the domains as low risk, high risk, and unclear risk of bias (Higgins 2020) .See Figure 2  Five RCTs reported that participants, personnel, and investigators were not blinded; therefore they were at high risk (Li 2004; Pascual 2018; Pastore 2014; Perimenis 2004; Perimenis 2007) .Melehan 2018 reported that participants and study investigators were blinded to treatment allocation (and adherence) for the duration of the trial, and we judged it at low risk. We assessed five RCTs at low risk of bias; four reported no losses (Li 2004; Pastore 2014; Perimenis 2004; Perimenis 2007) , while Melehan 2018 reported less than 10% loss.We judged Pascual 2018 at high risk of bias because of significant loss (18/75). Three RCTs did not provide enough information to assess reporting bias (unclear risk (Li 2004 ; Pastore 2014; Perimenis 2007)).We judged three RCTs at high risk of reporting bias: Melehan 2018 did not report all pre-planned time points for the primary outcome (four and eight weeks), not even in the supplementary material, and provided the data combined in pairs of interventions rather than individually, for the four intervention groups; Pascual 2018 presented a protocol registration date later than the inclusion of the first participant; and Perimenis 2004 did not report the number of adverse events. We found no other sources of potential bias, and judged the RCTs as having a low risk of bias for this domain. See: Summary of findings 1 Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) compared to no CPAP for improving erectile dysfunction in men with obstructive sleep apnoea; Summary of findings 2 Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) compared to sham CPAP for improving erectile dysfunction in men with obstructive sleep apnoea; Summary of findings 3 Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) compared to phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors for improving erectile dysfunction in men with obstructive sleep apnoea Considering the heterogeneity among included RCTs and the available data, we only conducted quantitative syntheses for the outcomes erectile dysfunction and sex-related quality of life, under the comparison of CPAP versus phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors.For all other outcomes and comparisons, we only completed qualitative syntheses. In Melehan 2018, authors did not report the results for each of the four intervention groups, but provided the results for two comparisons, based on the two-by-two factorial groups: • CPAP (combined with placebo or vardenafil) versus sham (combined with placebo or vardenafil); Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. • Vardenalfil (combined with CPAP or sham CPAP) versus placebo (combined with CPAP or sham CPAP). For this reason, we were unable to include the results from this RCT in our analyses. Two RCTs assessed this comparison (Li 2004; Pascual 2018) . Neither of the RCTs provided data on remission rate of ED, but both provided mean ED scores. One RCT assessed this outcome and the authors reported no serious adverse event a er four weeks (Li 2004 ). One RCT assessed this outcome and used the Self-Esteem and Relationship test (SEAR) (MD 1.00; 95% CI -8.09 to 10.09; one study; 57 participants; very low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to methodological limitations and imprecision; Analysis 1.2) (Pascual 2018). No RCTs assessed this outcome. No RCTs assessed this outcome. One RCT assessed this comparison, but we were unable to extract data for the outcomes for this comparison (Melehan 2018). Melehan 2018 assessed this outcome, but we were unable to extract separate data. Melehan 2018 did not assess this outcome. Melehan 2018 assessed this outcome with the EDITS tool, but we were unable to extract separate data. Melehan 2018 assessed this outcome with the SF-36, but we were unable to extract separate data. Melehan 2018 did not assess this outcome. None of RCTs provided data on remission rate of ED, but rather provided mean scores. Two RCTs measured this outcome (Perimenis 2004; Perimenis 2007) and reported that no adverse event was significant and no participant required any specific treatment, nor did they withdraw from the study (RR not estimable; participants = 70; studies = 2; very low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to methodological limitations and imprecision).Melehan 2018 measured this outcome with the EDITS, but did not report the results; Perimenis 2004 did not use a validated tool to measure this outcome. One RCT measured this outcome, using the SF-36, but did not report the results (Melehan 2018). 3) .The confidence interval was wide, and neither an important increase nor reduction in the risk of minor adverse events can be ruled out with the use of CPAP. This systematic review included six randomised controlled trials (RCT) with a total of 297 participants with obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) and erectile dysfunction (ED).We are uncertain about the e ectiveness and acceptability of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for erectile dysfunction when compared to no intervention, sham CPAP, or phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors for this condition. The main findings of this review showed the following: • There is uncertainty about the e ects of CPAP on ED at 4 and 12 weeks (very low-certainty evidence); • There is uncertainty about the e ects of CPAP on sex-related quality of life a er 12 weeks (very low-certainty evidence); • No other outcomes of interest were reported or assessed. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. The factorial design and reporting of the trial that examined this comparison meant that we were unable to extract outcomes matching our prespecified comparisons. • Sildenafil may slightly improve ED over CPAP at 12 weeks (lowcertainty evidence); • There is uncertainty about the e ects of CPAP on sex-related quality of life at 12 weeks (very low-certainty evidence); • There is uncertainty about the e ect of CPAP on serious and minor adverse events (very low-certainty evidence). The included RCTs exclusively addressed CPAP, so we are unaware of the e ects of bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), variable positive airway pressure (VPAP), or similar devices for men with OSAS and ED. It is important to highlight that even if the e ect suggested by the available evidence is true, this estimate refers to intermediate-term e ects, and may be not applicable for the long term, when for example, it is reasonable to expect additional adverse events with drugs and lower adherence to CPAP use. In addition, adherence to CPAP use was not assessed or reported by any of the included RCTs, and we are not sure if the recommendations were followed by participants of RCTs (mean of four or more hours of CPAP use per night, for at least four weeks, at any pressure level, and with any brand of machine).Finally, none of included RCTs provided data for remission rate of ED, but rather, they provided mean scores of ED.Other relevant outcomes were not considered or were poorly reported by the RCTs, such as sexrelated quality of life, and health-related quality of life. For this comparison no data was found for minor adverse events and heath-related quality of life.This evidence is derived from RCT including participants with mean age from 39.8 to 54.8 and moderate to severe OSAS. One RCT (Melehan 2018 ) considered this comparison, but the factorial design and reporting of this trial meant that we were unable to extract outcomes matching our pre-specified comparisons. For this comparison, none of included RCTs reported health-related quality of life.For ED, there is low evidence certainty that sildenafil may slightly improve ED scores, and for all other outcomes (sexrelated quality of life, serious and minor adverse events) the evidence available is so uncertain that no e ect estimate is known.We also noted that the two RCTs, used a high dose of sildenafil (100mg) which, although within the maximum recommended dose (25 mg to 100 mg), is higher than the doses used for most of the participants in clinical practice (25 mg to 50 mg).This evidence is derived from RCT including participants with mean age from 48 to 56 and moderate to severe OSAS. One RCT (Melehan 2018 ) considered this comparison, but the factorial design and reporting of this trial meant that we were unable to extract outcomes matching our pre-specified comparisons. For all the outcomes, the certainty of the evidence was low to very low, which means that no definitive recommendations can be made from the data available at the moment.We downgraded the certainty of the evidence due to methodological limitation of the RCTs and imprecision (few RCTs, small sample size, low rate of events, wide 95% CI including both a clinical important benefit or harm).See Summary of findings 1; Summary of findings 2; Summary of findings 3 for more details. Two review authors individually appraised all the studies, and the risk of any biases, other than those detailed in the risk of bias tables, is very unlikely.None of the review authors have any conflicts of interest to declare. We followed the recommendations of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions in all steps of this review to minimise bias (Higgins 2020) .The search strategy was broad and sensitive, and it is likely that it identified all randomised controlled trials.This can be considered one of the strengths of this review. Limitations of the review include the lack of some outcome data in the included studies; remission of erectile dysfunction could not be assessed due to lack of reporting of the number of participants achieving remission; the authors reported only the average with standard deviation.The available data were su icient for metaanalysis for only two outcomes (erectile dysfunction and sexrelated quality of life), from two RCTs. We did not identify any other systematic review that assessed the same clinical question addressed here. We identified one similar systematic review that considered the comparison CPAP versus sildenafil (Li 2019) .This review included 26 RCTs and observational studies.The literature search was restricted to three data sources, and sought reports published to 1 December 2018.As in our review, the results suggested that CPAP was less e ective than PDE5 inhibitors in the treating ED in men with OSAS, and the certainty of the evidence was low or very low. The current evidence does not support or refute the routine use of CPAP as a valid therapeutic option.We are uncertain about the e ectiveness and acceptability of CPAP for the treatment of erectile dysfunction in men with OSAP, when compared with no CPAP.When CPAP is compared with sildenafil, we found sildenafil may slightly improve erectile function at 12 weeks.

To assess the e ect of specified maternal postures for women with fetal malposition in labour on maternal and infant morbidity compared to other postures. We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth\\'s Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (13 July 2021), and reference lists of retrieved studies. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or cluster-RCTs conducted among labouring women with a fetal malposition confirmed by ultrasound or clinical examination, comparing a specified maternal posture with another posture.Quasi-RCTs and cross-over trials were not eligible for inclusion. Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, risk of bias, and performed data extraction.We used mean di erence (MD) for continuous variables, and risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous variables, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We included eight eligible studies with 1766 women. All studies reported some form of random sequence generation but were at high risk of performance bias due to lack of blinding.There was a high risk of selection bias in one study, detection bias in two studies, attrition bias in two studies, and reporting bias in two studies. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. The use of hands and knees posture may have little to no e ect on operative birth (average RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.50; 3 trials, 721 women; low-certainty evidence) and caesarean section (RR 1.34, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.87; 3 trials, 721 women; low-certainty evidence) but the evidence is uncertain; and very uncertain for epidural use (average RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.31; 2 trials, 282 women; very low-certainty evidence), instrumental vaginal birth (average RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.90; 3 trials, 721 women; very low-certainty evidence), severe perineal tears (average RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.03 to 22.30; 2 trials, 586 women; very low-certainty evidence), maternal satisfaction (average RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.54; 3 trials, 350 women; very low-certainty evidence), and Apgar scores less than seven at five minutes (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.21 to 2.34; 2 trials, 586 babies; very low-certainty evidence). No data were reported for the hands and knees comparisons for postpartum haemorrhage, serious neonatal morbidity, death (stillbirth or death of liveborn infant), admission to neonatal intensive care, neonatal encephalopathy, need for respiratory support, and neonatal jaundice requiring phototherapy. The use of lateral postures may have little to no e ect on reducing operative birth (average RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.19; 4 trials, 871 women; low-certainty evidence), caesarean section (average RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.39; 4 trials, 871 women; low-certainty evidence), instrumental vaginal birth (average RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.36; 4 trials, 871 women; low-certainty evidence), and maternal satisfaction (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.09; 2 trials, 451 women; low-certainty evidence), but the evidence is uncertain.The evidence is very uncertain about the e ect of lateral postures on severe perineal tears (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.17 to 2.48; 3 trials, 609 women; very low-certainty evidence), postpartum haemorrhage (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.70; 1 trial, 322 women; very low-certainty evidence), serious neonatal morbidity (RR 1.41, 95% CI 0.64 to 3.12; 3 trials, 752 babies; very low-certainty evidence), Apgar scores less than seven at five minutes (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.24; 1 trial, 322 babies; very low-certainty evidence), admissions to neonatal intensive care (RR 1.41, 95% CI 0.64 to 3.12; 2 trials, 542 babies; very low-certainty evidence) and neonatal death (stillbirth or death of liveborn) (1 trial, 210 women and their babies; no events). For the lateral posture comparisons, no data were reported for epidural use, neonatal encephalopathy, need for respiratory support, and neonatal jaundice requiring phototherapy.We were not able to estimate the outcome death (stillbirth or death of liveborn infant) due to no events (1 trial, 210 participants). We found low-and very low-certainty evidence which indicated that the use of hands and knees posture or lateral postures in women in labour with a fetal malposition may have little or no e ect on health outcomes of the mother or her infant.If a woman finds the use of hands and knees or lateral postures in labour comfortable there is no reason why they should not choose to use them.Further research is needed on the use of hands and knees and lateral postures for women with a malposition in labour.Trials should include further assessment of semi-prone postures, same-side-as-fetus lateral postures with or without hip hyperflexion, or both, and consider interventions of longer duration or that involve the early second stage of labour. Malposition is when the back of the baby\\'s head lies towards the mother\\'s back.As a result, labour and birth can be long and di icult, sometimes resulting in an operative birth (where the baby is delivered by caesarean section or with special tools to help the baby through the birth canal) and more perineal trauma (damage to the pelvic floor).The baby may be more likely to go to a neonatal care unit.Also, women may experience stress or disappointment with the birth experience. The way a pregnant woman is positioned during labour may help rotate a baby so that the back of the baby\\'s head lies towards the front of the mother\\'s abdomen.This improved position may help the mother and baby have a more normal labour and birth.However, it is not yet known which posture, if any, is e ective and when is the best time to use it. A systematic review of studies of positions (postures) used by women in labour with a baby in a malposition can provide answers on whether the postures improve birth and other health outcomes for mothers and babies.The summary of this review can be used to update clinical practice guidelines. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. We searched for evidence (published to 13 July 2021) and identified eight studies in nine di erent countries involving 1766 women and their babies.Women in the included studies were either first-time mothers or mothers who had birthed before.All the women\\'s pregnancies were at least at 36 weeks. The trials compared use of \\'hands and knees\\' posture or \\'side-lying\\' (lateral) postures (lying on the same side as the baby, lying on the opposite side to the baby, and lying semi-prone) to other postures (free posture, lying on back, leaning back, lying on the same side as the baby). For both the hands and knees posture and side-lying positions during labour, there may be little or no di erence in the numbers of operative births, haemorrhage (profuse bleeding of the mother), severe perineal trauma, and women\\'s satisfaction with their labour and delivery, but there was insu icient evidence to be sure.Many of our outcomes of interest were not reported in the included studies. Overall, we have little to no confidence in the evidence, mainly because there were too few women and babies in the studies, and some studies used unclear methods. Overall, it is uncertain whether hands and knees or side-lying positions in labour improve the health of mother and baby when a baby is in a malposition.However, if women find the use of hands and knees, side-lying, or other postures in labour comfortable, there is no reason why they should not choose to use them. Further research is needed to enable optimal fetal positioning.In particular, further research is needed on variations in the postures, the impact of longer use of these postures during labour, and on long-term outcomes for women and their babies.

In normal labour, the fetal head usually enters the maternal pelvis in the transverse diameter and then rotates anteriorly as the head descends into the mid pelvis.When the fetal head does not rotate anteriorly or instead rotates posteriorly the position is termed persistent and is a deviation from normal labour (Cunningham 2018) .Commonly referred to as \\'fetal malposition\\', it is described as occipito-posterior (OP) or \\'back-to-back\\' when the back of the fetal head lies posteriorly in the back of the mother\\'s pelvis and occipitotransverse (OT) when the back of the fetal head lies transversely (at the side of the mother\\'s pelvis).The head will o en be deflexed, likely due to forward application of the maternal sacral promontory on the fetal spine with consequential neck extension (Barth 2015) . A deflexed fetal head presents a wider diameter to the maternal pelvis which can cause delayed entry and transition through the pelvis.The fetal head may extend further to a mento-anterior or mento-lateral/transverse position (where the chin is anterior or lateral/transverse) to the maternal pelvis.Unlike a well-flexed head which presents a uniformly round vertex (crown of the head) to the cervix, a deflexed head is not completely round which may lead to poor application and thus pressure to the cervix.Poor head to cervix contact in nulliparous women is associated with cervical dystocia (cervix failing to open) (Allman 1996; Kjaergaard 2008) . When the fetus is in an OP position, the fetal axis or the long line of the fetal body in relation to the long axis of the woman, is inclined towards the mother\\'s symphysis pubis bone.In the case of an OT position, the fetus is inclined towards the opposite side of the mother\\'s pelvis.In both these positions, the fetal axis does not align well with the mother\\'s anteriorly tilted pelvic brim, unlike in an occipito-anterior (OA) positioned fetus where the fetal axis is towards the mother\\'s sacrum facilitating entry into the anteriorly tilted pelvic brim. Fetal malposition may be diagnosed by a vaginal digital examination which finds the junction of the sagittal and lambdoidal sutures of the fetal head located in the transverse diameter of the maternal pelvis for OT position or at least 45 degrees posterior to the transverse diameter of the maternal pelvis for OP position (Cunningham 2018) .Ultrasonographic detection of fetal malposition is more reliable than digital vaginal examination (Sherer 2002) .Ultrasonography to diagnose fetal malposition can locate the position of the fetal orbits or cervical spine anteriorly or transversely to the maternal pelvis (Akmal 2003; Souka 2003; Zahalka 2005) . A fetal OP position occurs in 15% to 33% of labours with a cephalic (head-first) presentation.Most OP positioned fetuses spontaneously rotate to an anterior position by the end of labour.However, about 8% that are OP in early labour, and 10% to 20% that are OP in the early second stage of labour, will remain in this position until birth, with 70% of these undergoing an operative vaginal birth (forceps or vacuum extraction) or caesarean section (Gardberg 1998; Fitzpatrick 2001; Ponkey 2003; Akmal 2004; Phipps 2014) .Women of African-American ethnicity have a higher prevalence of OP position during labour (Cheng 2006a).OP position is more prevalent in women with an under-developed pelvis associated with early age at first pregnancy (Blumenthal 1982) , malnutrition, and infection (Martins 2011) .OT position is associated with similar morbidities and occurs in 28% of labours, with 49% of these requiring an operative birth (Akmal 2004; Phipps 2014) .Considering the similar morbidities associated with OP and OT fetal positions, these are commonly grouped together in research (Doggett 1967) .Right OP/OT position is about twice as common as le OP/OT position (Randal 1952; Kutcipal 1959; Guittier 2016; Le Ray 2016) .During labour, the fetus will usually rotate on the pelvic floor anteriorly (to the front).However, when the fetus is in an OP position, the labour may be less likely to progress to the second stage, as shown by 53% OP position versus 38% non-OP position at caesarean section births for a prolonged first stage of labour (Eggebo 2015) . Fetal malposition is associated with a prolonged second stage labour (Senécal 2005), chorioamnionitis (Ponkey 2003), fetal distress (Ingemarsson 1980; Sokol 1981) , severe perineal trauma (Parente 2009) , anal sphincter injuries (Barbier 2007; Dudding 2008) , and birth injury (Cheng 2006b), including brachial plexus injury (Cheng 2006c), hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (Liljestrom 2018) , and subgaleal haematoma (Ashwal 2016) . Operative vaginal and caesarean section deliveries with an OP position are associated with postpartum haemorrhage, endometritis (Cheng 2006a), extension of the uterine incision during caesarean section especially in second stage labour (de la Torre 2006), and increased risk of need for neonatal resuscitation and neonatal intensive care unit admission (Cheng 2006a).The level of care available at a facility may impact health outcomes associated with a fetal malposition related to the degree of maternity experience and resources available (Aiken 2015) . Fetal malposition has direct and indirect costs, including longer postnatal hospital stays for women and their infants.The economic burden of third-and fourth-degree perineal tears in England due to longer hospital stays was estimated to be GBP 14.5 million for the year 2013/14 (Orlovic 2017) .A retrospective cohort study comparing women with severe perineal tears versus those without found the incidence of women having an OP positioned baby was 32% versus 4% respectively (Barbier 2007 ).In addition, there are ongoing costs of impaired sexual health (Lydon-Rochelle 2001), and emotional health, such as chronic post-traumatic stress disorder which has a prevalence of 1% to 2% following traumatic births (Wijma 1997; Ayers 2001) . The aetiology of OP fetal position is uncertain.The greater propensity for right OP/OT fetal position compared to le OP/ OT position may relate to dextrorotation of the uterus (oblique tilt of the uterus towards the right) with some fetuses on the right of the mother more inclined to rotate posteriorly and fetuses on the mother\\'s le to rotate anteriorly.Dextrorotation of up to 45 degrees is considered normal physiologically and occurs commonly in the gravid (pregnant) uterus, most likely due to the presence of the sigmoid colon (large bowel) on the maternal le (Anderson 1965; El-Mowafi 2017) .Fetal malposition is associated with nulliparity (Fitzpatrick 2001) , narrow pubic arch angle typical of the anthropoid and android pelvis (Suonio 1986; Gilboa 2013; Ghi 2016) , epidural analgesia (Lieberman 2005; Menichini 2021 ), anterior positioned placenta (Gardberg 1994) , advanced maternal Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews age, African-American ethnicity, fetal macrosomia (Cheng 2006a), and increased maternal body mass index (BMI) (Akmal 2004 ).An association between epidural anaesthesia and fetal malposition has been linked to lax maternal uterine muscles to impair anterior fetal rotation during the first stage of labour (Robinson 1996; Boog 2006) or lax pelvic floor muscles to impair anterior rotation in the second stage of labour (Lieberman 2005) . Knowing whether malposition exists in late pregnancy or develops in first or second stage labour is important so that e ective interventions can be appropriately timed before clinical situations, such as deep transverse arrest (transversely positioned fetal head stuck in the transverse diameter of the pelvis), occur.There is conflicting opinion regarding whether persistent OP position develops mostly during labour (nearly 70%) (Gardberg 1998; Lieberman 2005) , or from the onset of labour (Akmal 2004) . Several maternal postures in labour that have been previously studied include the hands and knees posture, lateral postures, which include lying on the same side as the fetus, lying on the opposite side as the fetus, semi-prone, and vertical postures (standing up or supported standing). Women may have been shown how to adopt specific posture/s as an intervention or may have used specific posture/s as a control.Use of the posture may have been for a specified time period or a collective minimum time requirement per hour or until birth of the baby.An ultrasound scan may have confirmed the fetal position prior to the intervention and during labour. There are two di erent pathways by which maternal posture might work to rotate the baby anteriorly.These include: changes in pelvic angles and diameters inducing fetal head flexion and anterior rotation (Desbriere 2013), and the forces of gravity and buoyancy (Andrews 2004) .Labour involves the passage of the shape of the baby through the shape of the pelvis.By adjusting the mother\\'s posture, the shape and angles of her pelvis may provide a better fit for the baby\\'s head shape.With e ective descent of the head in labour, pressure is applied to the cervix leading to full dilatation.The head when in contact with the firm pelvic floor can rotate anteriorly aided by the slightly concave incline of the levator ani muscles (Parente 2009) . Alternatively, rotation of the occiput to an OA position may occur with gravitational forces on fetal weight.For example, in the symmetrical Sims/semi-prone posture (mother lying in a lateralforwards posture on same side to location of fetal spine) the fetal spine, being the heaviest, may lead the weight of the fetal trunk by a falling action towards the centre of gravity, which is in this case located towards the mother\\'s anterior aspect of her abdomen. Once the fetal trunk rotates anteriorly, the occiput repositions anteriorly (the fetus untwists its neck) (Barth 2015) .An example of a similar mechanism is restitution, when, following the birth of the head, the head rotates to align with the trunk (Cunningham 2018) . Use of maternal posture may facilitate fetal rotation of OP or OT position to the more favourable OA position (Sutton 2000), coined as \\'optimal fetal positioning\\', and associated with better birth and health outcomes. Changes in maternal posture when there is a fetal malposition in labour may be a safe method to achieve a normal vaginal birth.As yet there is limited evidence on the appropriate maternal posture(s) to use, the optimal time to adopt the posture(s), or their e ectiveness. Conducting a systematic review of the evidence from randomised controlled trials of maternal posture in labour where there is a fetal malposition is important to establish their e ectiveness for correcting the malposition, the e ects on relevant maternal and infant morbidities, and the rates of operative births.The evidence from randomised trials summarised in this review is important for the update of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines. A previous Cochrane Review, titled \"Hands and knees posture in late pregnancy or labour for fetal malposition (lateral or posterior)\" (Hunter 2007) , found use of the hands and knees position for 10 minutes twice daily was not e ective for improving maternal and neonatal outcomes of labour.The position was associated with reduced backache in labour.This review indicated further research was required on posture and its e ect on progress or outcomes of labour in terms of pain, duration of labour, method of delivery, baby\\'s condition, and maternal satisfaction (Hunter 2007) .The Cochrane Review by Hunter and colleagues included randomised trials in late pregnancy and in labour.Since then, additional randomised trials on maternal posture for the management of labour in women with a fetus in OP or OT position have been conducted which use other posture interventions, some of which have reported positive e ects on maternal and neonatal outcomes.The publication of new trials indicated that an updated evidence synthesis was necessary, and we decided to split the previous Cochrane Review by Hunter and colleagues into two new reviews: the present review focuses on maternal postures for fetal malposition in labour for improving the health of mothers and their infants, and its sister review focuses on maternal postures for fetal malposition in late pregnancy for improving the health of mothers and their infants. To assess the e ect of specified maternal postures for women with fetal malposition in labour on maternal and infant morbidity compared to other postures. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (published or unpublished) only.Cluster-randomised trials and trials published only as abstracts were eligible for inclusion, but none were identified.Quasi-randomised trials and cross-over studies were not eligible for inclusion in this review.We assessed trial methodology and risk of bias from full texts; none of the trials were reported only as abstracts. We included information from other study designs in the Background and Discussion but we did not use it to inform the results or conclusions of this review. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Women in labour with a malposition of the fetus (occipito-posterior (OP), occipito-transverse (OT) (lateral), mento anterior/transverse (lateral)) diagnosed by digital vaginal examination or ultrasound. Specified maternal postures for women in labour with a fetal malposition compared with other maternal postures.This may have included maternal side-lying on the same side as the fetal spine, maternal side-lying on the opposite side to the fetal spine, maternal side-lying with hyperflexed hip/s, hand and knees posture, standing, semi-recumbent/recumbent (lying flat on back), sitting, squatting, or other postures.The intervention was compared with other postures, specified or unspecified, that excluded the intervention postures. The primary and secondary maternal and neonatal outcome measures were based on consensus between the review authors. • Operative birth (composite outcome defined as caesarean section, instrumental vaginal birth) • Serious neonatal morbidity (composite outcome defined as death, admission to neonatal intensive care, neonatal encephalopathy, or as defined by trialists) Maternal Short-term outcomes The following section of this review is based on a standard template used by Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth. We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth\\'s Trials Register by contacting their Information Specialist (13 July 2021). The Register is a database containing over 27,000 reports of controlled trials in the field of pregnancy and childbirth.It represents over 30 years of searching.For full current search methods used to populate Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth\\'s Trials Register -including the detailed search strategies for the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL); the list of handsearched journals and conference proceedings; and the list of journals reviewed via the current awareness service -please follow this link. Briefly, Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth\\'s Trials Register is maintained by their Information Specialist and contains trials identified from: • monthly searches of CENTRAL; • weekly searches of MEDLINE (Ovid); • weekly searches of Embase (Ovid); • monthly searches of CINAHL (EBSCO); • handsearches of 30 journals and the proceedings of major conferences; • weekly current awareness alerts for a further 44 journals plus monthly BioMed Central email alerts. Two people screen these search results and review the full texts of all relevant trial reports identified.Based on the intervention described, they assign each trial report a number corresponding to a specific Pregnancy and Childbirth review topic (or topics) and add the trial reports to the Register.\\'The Information Specialist searched the Register for this review using a topic number rather than keywords.This resulted in a more specific search set that has been fully accounted for in the relevant review sections (Included studies, Excluded studies, and Studies awaiting classification). In addition, we searched ClinicalTrials.govand the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (ICTRP) for unpublished, planned, and ongoing trial reports using the search methods detailed in Appendix 1. We searched the reference lists of retrieved studies.We did not apply any language or date restrictions. The following section of this protocol is based on a standard template used by Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group (Figure 1 ). Screening eligible studies for trustworthiness At least two review authors evaluated all studies meeting our inclusion criteria against predefined criteria to select studies that, based on available information, were deemed to be su iciently trustworthy to be included in the analysis.Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth have developed a Trustworthiness Screening Tool (CPC-TST) which includes the following criteria. • Are there any retraction notices or expressions of concern listed on the Retraction Watch Database relating to this study?• Was the study prospectively registered (for those studies published a er 2010)?If not, was there a plausible reason?• When requested, did the trial authors provide/share the protocol, the ethics approval letter, or both?• Did the trial authors engage in communication with the Cochrane Review authors within the agreed timelines?• Did the trial authors provide individual patient data (IPD) upon request?If not, was there a plausible reason? • Is the study free from participant characteristics that appear too similar (e.g.distribution of the mean (SD) excessively narrow or excessively wide, as noted by Carlisle 2017)? • Is the study free from characteristics that could be implausible (e.g.large numbers of women with a rare condition (such as severe cholestasis in pregnancy) recruited within 12 months)?• In cases with (close to) zero losses to follow-up, is there a plausible explanation? • Is the study free from results that could be implausible (e.g.massive risk reduction for main outcomes with small sample size)?• Do the numbers randomised to each group suggest that adequate randomisation methods were used (e.g. is the study free from issues such as unexpectedly even numbers of women Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews \\'randomised\\' including a mismatch between the numbers and the methods, if the authors say \\'no blocking was used\\' but still end up with equal numbers, or if the authors say they used \\'blocks of 4\\' but the final numbers di er by 6)? We did not include studies assessed as being potentially \\'high risk\\' in the review.For studies classified as \\'high risk,\\' we attempted to contact the study authors to address any possible lack of information or concerns.In cases where we could not obtain contact details for the study authors, or where adequate information remained unavailable, we listed the study as \\'awaiting classification\\' and described in detail the reasons and our communications with the author (or lack thereof). We included data from abstracts only if, in addition to the trustworthiness assessment, the study authors had confirmed in writing that the data to be included in the review had come from the final analysis and would not change.If such information was not available/provided, the study would remain in \\'awaiting classification\\' (as above). See Figure 2 for details of how we applied the trustworthiness screening criteria. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Two review authors independently assessed for inclusion or exclusion all potential studies identified as a result of the search strategy.We resolved any disagreement on inclusion or exclusion through discussion; if required, we consulted a third review author. We created a study flow diagram to map out the number of records identified, included, and excluded. We designed a data extraction form based on the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group\\'s data extraction form.Two review authors collected information from the eligible studies relating to type of intervention, timing of intervention, concomitant treatments, and maternal and infant outcomes.We collected information about sources of funding and any declarations of interest by trialists.We resolved any disagreements through discussion.We entered all data from the data extraction forms into Review Manager 5.3 so ware (Review Manager 2014) and checked the data for accuracy.We attempted to contact authors of original reports if required to provide clarity or further information. Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias (ROB) for each study using methods described for ROB 1.0 in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011) . We judged risk of biases as low, high, or unclear.We resolved any disagreement through discussion or by the involvement of a third assessor. (1) Random sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias) We described for each included study the method of allocation sequence in su icient detail to determine the equipoise and thus comparability of groups.We assessed the method as: • low risk of bias (unequivocal randomisation design, e.g.random number list; computer-generated random assignment); • high risk of bias (use of alternation, e.g.date of birth, case record number, date of presentation, or other quasi randomisation); or • unclear risk of bias (e.g.incomplete statement of the randomisation process). (2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias) We described for each included study the method used to conceal allocation to intervention assignment before and until assignment and assessed whether such allocation could have been foreseen during this time.We assessed the method as: • low risk of bias (e.g.central or telephone randomisation by a third party; sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes); • high risk of bias (unconcealed random allocation; e.g.unsealed or non-opaque envelopes); or • unclear risk of bias (e.g.incomplete details of central randomisation process, unmarked envelopes prior to opening). We described for each included study the reported method that was used (if any) for blinding of participants, personnel, or both.For each included study methodology that used unblinded participants, personnel, or both, we judged whether this lack of blinding would be likely to a ect the results.We assessed methods as low, high, or unclear risk of bias for participants and personnel, respectively. (3.2) Blinding of outcome assessment (checking for possible detection bias) We described each included study\\'s method of blinding outcome assessors to the intervention and assessed risk of bias for categories of outcomes (e.g.subjective or objective) separately as required.We assessed the method as low, high, or unclear risk of bias. (4) Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias due to the amount, nature, and handling of incomplete outcome data) We described for each included study, and for each outcome or class of outcomes, the completeness of data, including attrition and exclusions from the analysis.We state whether attrition and exclusions were reported, and the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes.Where su icient information was reported, or was supplied by the trial authors, we re-included missing data in the planned analyses. We assessed methods as: • low risk of bias (e.g.no missing outcome data; missing outcome data balanced across groups); • high risk of bias (e.g.numbers or reasons for missing data imbalanced across groups; \\'as treated\\' analysis done with substantial departure of intervention received from that assigned at randomisation); • unclear risk of bias. (5) Selective reporting (checking for reporting bias) We described for each included study how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found.We assessed the methods as: • low risk of bias (where it was clear that all of the study\\'s prespecified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review were reported); • high risk of bias (where not all the study\\'s pre-specified outcomes were reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest were reported incompletely and so could not be used; study failed to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported); • unclear risk of bias. We described for each included study any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias.We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias: Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. • low risk of other bias; • high risk of other bias; • unclear whether there is risk of other bias. We made explicit judgements about whether studies were at high risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the CochraneHandbook (Higgins 2021) .With reference to (1) to (6) above, we assessed the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and whether we considered it was likely to impact on the findings.We explored the impact of the level of bias through undertaking sensitivity analyses.See Sensitivity analysis. For dichotomous data, we presented results as summary risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous data, we used the mean di erences (MDs) with 95% CIs if outcomes were measured in the same way between trials.Where di erent methods of measurement were used, we planned to use the standardised mean di erence with 95% CIs to combine trials that measured the same outcome, but used di erent methods. We did not identify any cluster-RCTs.In future updates, if there are cluster-RCTs that meet our inclusion criteria, we will combine them with individually randomised trials in the analyses.We will adjust their sample sizes using the methods described in the Cochrane Handbook (Higgins 2022; Chapter 23) , using an estimate of the intracluster correlation co-e icient (ICC) derived from the trial (if possible), from a similar trial, or from a study of a similar population.If we use ICCs from other sources, we will report this and conduct sensitivity analyses to investigate the e ect of variation in the ICC.If we identify both cluster-randomised trials and individually-randomised trials, we plan to synthesise the relevant information.We will consider it reasonable to combine the results from both if there is little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the e ect of intervention and the choice of randomisation unit is considered to be unlikely.We will also acknowledge heterogeneity in the randomisation unit and perform a sensitivity analysis to investigate the e ects of the randomisation unit. Unit of analysis issues may arise when randomised women have a multiple pregnancy.We presented maternal data as per randomised woman and neonatal data as per infant. Where trials had multiple arms, we used methods described in the Cochrane Handbook to avoid unit of analysis issues (Higgins 2022; Chapter 23) , such as double counting of participants, by combining groups to create a single pair-wise comparison if appropriate, or by splitting the \\'shared group\\' into two or more groups with smaller sample sizes and included two or more comparisons. For included studies, we noted levels of attrition.We explored the impact of including studies with high levels of missing data in the overall assessment of treatment e ect by using sensitivity analysis. For all outcomes, we carried out analyses, as far as possible, on an intention-to-treat basis; that is, we attempted to include all participants randomised to each group in the analyses, and all participants were analysed in the group to which they were allocated, regardless of whether or not they received the allocated intervention.The denominator for each outcome in each trial was the number randomised minus any participants whose outcomes were known to be missing. We assessed statistical heterogeneity in each meta-analysis using the Tau , I and Chi statistics.We regarded heterogeneity as substantial if I was greater than 30% and either Tau was greater than zero, or there was a low P value (less than 0.10) in the Chi test for heterogeneity. If there had been 10 or more studies in the meta-analysis,we planned to investigate reporting biases (such as publication bias) using funnel plots.We planned to assess funnel plot asymmetry visually.If asymmetry was apparent, we planned to perform exploratory analyses to investigate it. We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager 5 so ware (Review Manager 2014).We used fixed-e ect metaanalysis for pooling data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment e ect: that is, where trials were examining the same intervention, and the trials\\' populations and methods were judged su iciently similar.If there was clinical heterogeneity su icient to expect that the underlying treatment e ects di ered between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected, we used random-e ects meta-analysis to produce an overall summary if an average treatment e ect across trials was considered clinically meaningful.The random-e ects summary was treated as the average of the range of possible treatment e ects and we discussed the clinical implications of treatment e ects di ering between trials.If the average treatment e ect was not clinically meaningful, we did not combine trials. Where we used random-e ects analyses, we presented the results as the average treatment e ects with 95% CIs, and the estimates of Tau and I . Where we identified substantial heterogeneity, we planned to investigate it using subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses.We planned to consider whether an overall summary was meaningful, and if it was, to use random-e ects analysis to produce it. We planned to carry out the following subgroup analyses: Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. • parity (para 0 versus para ≥ 1); • body mass index (BMI) (< 25 versus ≥ 25); • birthweight (< 90th centile versus ≥ 90th centile); • fetal position (le occipito-posterior/transverse versus right occipito-posterior/transverse); • level of care facility (primary facility versus secondary or tertiary facility); • ultrasound confirmation of malposition (ultrasound versus no ultrasound to confirm malposition). We planned to restrict subgroup analysis to the review\\'s primary outcomes. We assessed subgroup di erences by interaction tests available within Review Manager (Review Manager 2014).Results of subgroup analyses were to be reported quoting the Chi 2 statistic and P value, and the I value. Where there was significant heterogeneity or risk of bias associated with the quality of some of the included trials, we explored this with a sensitivity analysis for the primary outcomes.We compared trials with a low risk of bias for randomisation (including sequence generation, concealment of allocation, blinding) as well as an overall low risk of bias to trials judged as having a high or unclear risk of bias to measure if there was any di erence to the result for primary outcomes. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach, as outlined in the GRADE handbook (Schünemann 2013), for the following outcomes. • Operative birth (caesarean section, instrumental vaginal birth) We used the GRADEpro Guideline Development tool (GRADEpro GDT) to import data from Review Manager 5.3 (Review Manager 2014) in order to create summary of findings tables.We produced a summary of the intervention e ect and a measure of certainty for each of the above outcomes using the GRADE approach.The GRADE approach uses five considerations (study limitations, consistency of e ect, imprecision, indirectness, and publication bias) to assess the certainty of the body of evidence for each outcome.The evidence can be downgraded from \\'high certainty\\' by one level for serious (or by two levels for very serious) limitations, depending on assessments for risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of e ect estimates, or potential publication bias. This section describes the studies considered for inclusion in this review. We assessed 26 study reports from the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth search (July 2021), and two identified through other sources (Kariminia 2004; Molina-Reyes 2014) . We included eight studies (21 reports) and excluded three (four reports).Three studies, Lu 2001 , Ou 1997 and Wu 2001 , require further details to assess eligibility and therefore remain awaiting classification. See Figure 2 . From the 11 studies identified as potentially eligible for inclusion, three studies, Lu 2001 , Ou 1997 and Wu 2001 , did not meet the criteria for trustworthiness for the following reasons.In all three, there was uncertainty about the randomisation process used, including no explanation of how women were allocated to each study group and who decided this, and no details of human ethics approval.We made every e ort to contact authors.However, we could not locate contact details for authors of two studies, and authors of the remaining study did not respond.See Studies awaiting classification. Nearly three-quarters of participants (n = 1287/1766) were recruited for trials published in the last seven years. Le Ray 2016 and Guittier 2016 were the largest trials, randomising 322 and 439 women, respectively.Sample sizes for Desbriere 2013 and Liu 2018 were 200 and 226, respectively.The remaining four trials had sample sizes ranging from 120 to 180 (Bahmaei 2018; Bueno-Lopez 2018; Molina-Reyes 2014; Stremler 2005) . Five of the eight included trials were conducted in Europe.Of these, three were in France (Desbriere 2013; Guittier 2016; Le Ray 2016), and two were in Spain (Bueno-Lopez 2018; Molina-Reyes 2014).One trial was conducted in China (Liu 2018), one in Iran (Bahmaei 2018), and one multicentre trial was held in 13 universitya iliated hospitals worldwide (Stremler 2005) .All of the trials included tertiary level hospitals and one trial, Le Ray 2016, also included Level 1 (primary care -in a community setting) and Level 2 (secondary care -hospital-based care with specialist level care available) hospitals. All eight included trials had participants with a singleton pregnancy in early or active phase of labour with an OP fetal position confirmed via ultrasonography.One study confirmed fetal position with a second vaginal examination by another midwife or obstetrician if ultrasonography was not possible (Molina-Reyes 2014).Seven of the eight included trials recruited participants from 37 weeks\\' gestational age and one trial recruited women from 36 weeks\\' gestational age (Desbriere 2013).In one trial, all participants had an epidural at time of randomisation (Bueno-Lopez 2018), and in another trial, 93% of participants had epidural analgesia at the time of randomisation (Guittier 2016).In four of the trials, more than 90% of participants had epidural analgesia at the time of randomisation (Bueno-Lopez 2018; Desbriere 2013; Guittier 2016; Le Ray 2016).One trial had low numbers of women with an epidural analgesia at the time of randomisation (Stremler 2005), and one trial had fewer women with epidurals in the hands and knees posture group compared to the decubitus lateral group (Molina-Reyes 2014).Two trials did not report the use of epidural use or had no use of analgesia (Liu 2018 and Bahmaei 2018, respectively) . Four of the included trials utilised the hands and knees posture (Bahmaei 2018; Guittier 2016; Molina-Reyes 2014; Stremler 2005) .In one of these trials, the posture used was described as prostration, in which the chest was on the bed, the hips were higher than the chest, and the hips rocked side to side for 15 to 30 minutes every hour (Bahmaei 2018).Two of the trials using the hands and knees posture similarly described the torso as either tilted forwards with back stretched (Guittier 2016), or the hands on the mattress, forearms on headboard, or thorax resting on a ball (Molina-Reyes 2014), for a minimum of 10 minutes or 30 minutes, respectively, a er which women could remain in the posture or change postures.In the Stremler 2005 trial, the hands and knees posture was used for a minimum of 30 minutes and up to 60 minutes, and women were encouraged to continue the posture for the remainder of their labour. Among the four trials using hands and knees as the intervention posture, two trials used free posture as the comparator (Guittier 2016; Stremler 2005) .Specifically, women continued to use their pre-randomisation posture (excluding hands and knees) for at least one hour a er randomisation a er which they could adopt the hands and knees posture if they chose to (Guittier 2016), or use any posture except hands and knees, or any position that suspended the abdomen, and were encouraged to observe this exemption a er the study period (Stremler 2005) .Of the remaining two trials, Bahmaei 2018 used supine or lateral posture as the comparator which was maintained throughout labour, and Molina-Reyes 2014 used same-side-as fetus, decubitus-lateral posture as the comparator for a minimum of 30 minutes, or if no rotation occurred for those with a direct fetal occiput a er 30 minutes, then the woman would adopt the contralateral posture (opposite side to fetus).A er the intervention period, the women could use any posture they wished. Five of the included trials utilised lateral posture interventions (Bahmaei 2018; Bueno-Lopez 2018; Desbriere 2013; Le Ray 2016; Liu 2018) .Of these, two trials utilised a lateral posture in which the woman lay on the same side as their fetus (Bueno-Lopez 2018; Desbriere 2013), two trials utilised contralateral postures (opposite side to the fetus) (Le Ray 2016; Liu 2018), and one trial utilised a semi-prone lateral posture non-specific to fetal position in which the superior leg was hyperflexed, inferior leg slightly flexed, inferior arm placed towards the back and the superior arm was flexed (Bahmaei 2018). One trial utilising the lateral decubitus posture on the same side as the fetus described the posture as a modified Sims posture in which the superior leg was flexed and the inferior leg straight (Bueno-Lopez 2018).The woman adopted this posture for 40 minutes every hour until either rotation or birth occurred.Women in the comparator group adopted free positions, but could only use lateral postures for up to 20 minutes each hour, and continued until either rotation or birth occurred.Another trial utilised a sequence of three postures, two of which were lateral decubitus postures on the same side as the fetus, depending on the station of the fetal head (Desbriere 2013).Specifically, a woman with a fetal head station between -5 cm and -3 cm adopted the hands and knees posture (Posture 1) (13%); and as the fetal station came to between -2 cm to 0 cm, they adopted \\'Posture 2\\', a strict lateral recumbent position on the same side of the fetal spine with the inferior leg flexed and the superior leg positioned in the axis of the body; then at fetal head station greater than 0 cm, they adopted \\'Posture 3\\', similar to \\'Posture 2\\' but with the inferior leg in the axis of the body and the superior leg flexed at 90 degrees with the use of a leg support.If anterior rotation occurred, a woman was asked to adopt the dorsal recumbent position.Women in the comparator group adopted the dorsal recumbent (supine) posture. Two trials utilising contralateral intervention postures included hip flexion (superior leg) of 90 degrees or more (Le Ray 2016; Liu 2018).One trial placed the foot of the woman\\'s superior leg on a foot pedal so the knee was as close to the abdomen as possible (Liu 2018).This intervention was compared with a contralateral posture without extreme hip flexion and abduction in which the Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews superior leg was flexed less than 90 degrees and the inferior leg was straight.The other trial had the woman\\'s inferior leg straight and the posture was maintained for 30 to 60 minutes (Le Ray 2016).A er one hour the woman was asked to continue the posture for as long as possible during the first stage of labour, a er which the midwife or obstetrician could recommend maternal postures or attempt manual rotation according to the unit\\'s practice.This intervention was compared to the use of the dorsal recumbent (supine) posture for one hour a er randomisation then for as long as possible during labour.Later in labour, the woman could use any comparator position, except the lateral decubitus position, if they wanted or needed to due to fetal heart rate abnormalities.A er the first stage, midwives and obstetricians could recommend other maternal postures or attempt manual rotation according to the unit\\'s practice. The primary maternal outcome of operative birth (composite outcome defined as caesarean section, instrumental vaginal birth) was reported in seven of the eight included trials standard error of the mean was reported so we converted this to standard deviation.The Molina-Reyes 2014 trial reported the di erence between mean pain score before the intervention and in labour as categorical variables of either \\'less\\', \\'equivalent\\' or \\'more\\'.For the meta-analysis, we used the \\'more\\' pain score.Three other trials reported on pain score (Bahmaei 2018; Guittier 2016; Stremler 2005) ; however, we could not include these in the meta-analyses as there was either no report of standard deviation, total participants, or median and range.Comfort with the intervention was reported by two trials using Likert scales (Guittier 2016; Le Ray 2016).We used the categories \\'comfort improved\\' and \\'comfortable/very comfortable\\' from Guittier 2016 and Le Ray 2016, respectively, for this review.Epidural use was reported in three trials (Desbriere 2013; Molina-Reyes 2014; Stremler 2005) .Occipito-posterior/transverse position at birth was reported in five trials (Desbriere 2013; Le Ray 2016; Liu 2018; Molina-Reyes 2014; Stremler 2005) .Episiotomy was reported in three trials (Bueno-Lopez 2018; Desbriere 2013; Le Ray 2016).Severe perineal tears (third degree or higher, as defined by trialists) was reported in four trials (Bueno-Lopez 2018; Desbriere 2013; Guittier 2016; Le Ray 2016) .Postpartum haemorrhage (as defined by trialists) was reported in one trial (Le Ray 2016).Maternal satisfaction (as defined by trialists using standardised tools) was reported in three trials (Bahmaei 2018; Molina-Reyes 2014; Stremler 2005) .Of these, Bahmaei 2018 and Molina-Reyes 2014 defined satisfaction as satisfaction with the delivery/birth experience, and Stremler 2005 defined satisfaction by whether women used the posture a er the one-hour study period, as well as a mean score to evaluate the intervention position using the Labour Agentry Scale (Hodnett 1987) .The Bueno-Lopez 2018 trial only reported two of the questions about satisfaction and only used P values, so we could not include its data.None of the trials reported on OT arrest, postnatal depression (as defined by trialists), any breastfeeding on discharge, operative pelvic floor repair post discharge, or posttraumatic stress referrals. The primary neonatal outcome of serious neonatal morbidity (composite outcome defined as death, admission to neonatal intensive care, neonatal encephalopathy, or as defined by trialists) was reported in three trials (Desbriere 2013; Le Ray 2016; Liu 2018).Death (stillbirth or death of a liveborn infant) was reported (as nil in both groups) in one trial (Liu 2018).Apgar score less than seven at five minutes was reported in three trials (Guittier 2016; Le Ray 2016; Stremler 2005) .Admission to neonatal intensive care unit was reported in two trials (Desbriere 2013; Le Ray 2016).Birth trauma was reported in only one trial (Desbriere 2013).No trials reported on neonatal encephalopathy (as defined by trialists), need for respiratory support, neonatal jaundice requiring phototherapy, increased lactates or low PH (as defined by trialists), or disability including developmental delay (as defined by trialists).The remaining trial, Desbriere 2013, did not report their funding sources. Of the three excluded studies, two were ineligible due to trial participants not being in labour (Andrews 1981; Kariminia 2004) , and one due to participants not specifically having an OP/OT malposition (Zhang 2017). We assessed risk of bias from full-text versions of all eight included trials (Bahmaei 2018; Bueno-Lopez 2018; Desbriere 2013; Guittier 2016; Le Ray 2016; Liu 2018; Molina-Reyes 2014; Stremler 2005) (see Figure 3 and Figure 4 ).All included trials were at risk of performance bias due to unblinding (Figure 3 ; Figure 4 ).We assessed one trial as high risk for allocation bias.High risk of reporting bias applied to two trials. We assessed seven trials as being at low risk of selection bias We judged Desbriere 2013 to be at unclear risk of selection bias because, although it used permutated blocks of four, it provided no details on the source of the random sequence.We judged Molina-Reyes 2014 to be at high risk for allocation concealment as the midwife (possibly providing care) consulted the list of random numbers.The remaining four trials did not report a method for concealing allocation, such as use of an independent person responsible for accessing the randomisation so ware or random digit table and whether the random digit table was visible to sta (Bahmaei 2018; Bueno-Lopez 2018; Desbriere 2013; Liu 2018).We rated these as being at unclear risk of bias. Given the nature of the intervention (maternal posture in labour) and comparison (use of another maternal posture), it was not possible for participants or caregivers, midwives, and obstetricians to be blinded to the allocated groups, and thus we judged the risk of performance bias to be high for all eight included trials.We judged three trials to be at low risk of detection bias due to blinding of outcome assessors (Bueno-Lopez 2018; Stremler 2005; Bahmaei 2018).We assessed three trials to be at unclear risk of detection bias: in two trials, due to the midwife or obstetrician involved in care performing the ultrasound scan before operative births and collecting fetal position at birth for two trials (Desbriere 2013; Guittier 2016); and in one trial, there was no mention of whether outcome assessors were blinded (Liu 2018).We judged two trials to be at high risk of detection bias due to lack of blinding of the midwives and obstetricians who assessed outcomes and randomly assigned groups ( We considered the majority (six) of the trials to be at low risk of attrition bias, with minimal or no losses to follow-up (Bahmaei 2018; Bueno-Lopez 2018; Desbriere 2013; Guittier 2016; Le Ray 2016; Stremler 2005) .In one of these trials, information for one participant in the intervention group was lost (Bueno-Lopez 2018). We judged the two remaining trials to be at high risk of attrition bias due to incomplete outcome data and no intention-to-treat analysis (Liu 2018; Molina-Reyes 2014).In Molina-Reyes 2014, 11 participants (14.5%) were lost to follow-up in the intervention group and no participants lost from the control group.In Liu 2018, there was loss to follow-up in both groups: nine (7.8%) in the study group and seven (6.25%) in the control group. We judged five of the eight trials to be at low risk of selective reporting bias as all outcomes in the study methods were reported (Desbriere 2013; Guittier 2016; Le Ray 2016; Liu 2018; Molina-Reyes 2014; Stremler 2005) . We judged two trials to be at high risk of selective reporting bias (Bueno-Lopez 2018; Bahmaei 2018).The Bueno-Lopez 2018 trial did not report duration of first and second stage labour despite it being listed as an outcome in their trial protocol, and although intention-to-treat analysis was intended, one set of notes was lost. The Bahmaei 2018 trial only reported two of the 10 trial outcomes (labour pain intensity and maternal satisfaction); it did not report the primary outcome (correction of OP head position).We did not locate any other publications of the outcomes.We judged Liu 2018 to have an unclear risk of selective reporting bias due to no pretrial registration or protocol; therefore, it was unclear if all planned outcomes were reported. We No trials reported operative birth by any of the pre-specified subgroups. None of the four trials in the hands and knees posture comparison reported on death or serious neonatal morbidity. Fetal malposition (OP/OT) a er the intervention The evidence is uncertain that use of the hands and knees posture compared to other postures results in a reduction in the outcome fetal malposition (OP/OT) a er the intervention because the CI includes the line of no e ect (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.00; Chi 2 = 0.38 (P = 0.83), I 2 = 0%; 3 trials (Guittier 2016; Molina-Reyes 2014; Stremler 2005), 688 women; Analysis 1.2).The Bahmaei 2018 trial did not report this outcome. The evidence suggests use of the hands and knees posture has little or no e ect on the duration of labour compared to the use of other posture (mean di erence (MD -0.26 hours, 95% CI -0.75 to 0.22; Chi 2 = 1.42 (P = 0.49), I 2 = 0%; 3 trials (Guittier 2016; Molina-Reyes 2014; Stremler 2005), 721 women; Analysis 1.3).We converted data for Stremler 2005 from mean and interquartile range to mean and standard deviation.Again, the remaining trial did not report on duration of labour (Bahmaei 2018). There may be little or no di erence in the requirement for oxytocin augmentation of labour in women using hands and knees posture compared to other postures (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.30; 147 women; Analysis 1.4), however, the evidence is from only one trial (Stremler 2005) .Three trials in this comparison did not report on oxytocin use during labour (Bahmaei 2018; Guittier 2016; Molina-Reyes 2014). Pain score (as defined by trialists using standardised tools) The evidence is uncertain that the hands and knees posture compared to other postures results in a reduction in pain score because the CI includes the line of no e ect (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.01; 110 women; Analysis 1.5), however, the evidence is from only one trial (Molina-Reyes 2014).The authors defined pain a er the intervention as either major, minor, or equal to pre-intervention pain.For this review, we report major pain.We could not use pain score data provided in Stremler 2005 because they gave no standard deviation, and in Bahmaei 2018 because they provided no totals.The use of hands and knees posture may result in little or no di erence in mean pain score compared to other postures (MD 0.05, 95% CI -0.29 to 0.39; 439 women; Analysis 1.6); however, the evidence was from one trial (Guittier 2016).Pain was reported as median and range which we converted to mean and standard deviation.There were likely more events of improved comfort in the hands and knees posture compared to other postures (RR 1.75, 95% CI 1.25 to 2.46; P = 0.001; 1 trial (Guittier 2016), 411 women; Analysis 1.7).Another study that reported increased comfort only provided percentages (Molina-Reyes 2014), so we could not include their data in the meta-analysis. The The evidence is uncertain about the e ect of the hands and knees posture compared to other postures on caesarean section because the CI is compatible with a range of e ects encompassing both a small benefit but also appreciable harm (RR 1.34, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.87; Chi 2 = 2.48 (P = 0.29), I 2 = 19%; 3 trials (Guittier 2016; Molina-Reyes 2014; Stremler 2005), 721 women; low-certainty evidence; Analysis 1.10).One trial in this comparison did not report caesarean section (Bahmaei 2018). The hands and knees posture may result in little or no di erence in instrumental vaginal birth compared to other postures, but the evidence is very uncertain (average RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.90; Tau 2 = 0.18, Chi 2 = 5.99 (P = 0.05)), I 2 = 67%; 3 trials (Guittier 2016; Molina-Reyes 2014; Stremler 2005), 721 women; very lowcertainty evidence; Analysis 1.11).Heterogeneity may be explained in part by the 14.5% attrition in one trial (Molina-Reyes 2014), and the short duration of intervention (minimum 10 minutes) in the Guittier 2016 trial.A er removing Molina-Reyes 2014 in a sensitivity analysis, heterogeneity was reduced to I 2 = 29% but did not change the result.One trial did not report this outcome (Bahmaei 2018). The evidence is very uncertain about the e ect of the hands and knees posture compared to other postures on the outcome episiotomy because the CI is compatible with a wide range of e ects encompassing both appreciable benefit and also harm (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.91; 147 women; Analysis 1.12).However, the evidence is from only one trial.Three trials did not report this outcome (Bahmaei 2018; Guittier 2016; Molina-Reyes 2014). Severe perineal tears (third degree or higher, as defined by trialists) The evidence is very uncertain about the e ect of the hands and knees posture compared to other postures on women sustaining severe perineal tears (third degree or higher) because the CI is compatible with a wide range of e ects encompassing both appreciable benefit and also harm (average RR 0. No trials in the hands and knees comparison reported occipitotransverse arrest, postpartum haemorrhage, postnatal depression, any breastfeeding on discharge, or the long-term outcomes of operative pelvic floor repair post discharge or post-traumatic stress referrals. The evidence is very uncertain about the e ect of the hands and knees posture compared to other postures on the outcome Apgar score less than seven at five minutes because the CI is compatible with a wide range of e ects encompassing both appreciable benefit and also harm (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.21 to 2.34; Chi 2 = 0.81 (P = 0.37), I 2 = 0%; 2 trials (Guittier 2016; Stremler 2005), 586 women and their babies; very low-certainty evidence; Analysis 1.16).Two trials did not report this outcome (Bahmaei 2018; Molina-Reyes 2014). There were no events of birth trauma in the only trial reporting this outcome (Stremler 2005) . No trials in the hands and knees comparison reported death (stillbirth or death of liveborn infant), admission to neonatal intensive care, neonatal encephalopathy, need for respiratory support, neonatal jaundice requiring phototherapy, increased cord lactates or low pH, or the long-term outcome of disability including developmental delay. Five trials used lateral postures The evidence is very uncertain if lateral postures compared to other postures may reduce the outcome fetal malposition a er the intervention because the CI is compatible with both appreciable benefit and also no e ect (average RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.08; Tau 2 = 0.15, Chi 2 = 22.08 (P < 0.001), I 2 = 86%; 4 trials (Bueno-Lopez 2018; Desbriere 2013; Le Ray 2016; Liu 2018), 864 women; Analysis 2.2).The heterogeneity is not explained by whether same-side or contralateral side was used: separate comparisons for same-side or contralateral side posture show similar results.However, one trial timed the intervention in late labour and measured the outcome 60 minutes later when women were more likely to have entered the second stage (Liu 2018), when counter pressure from the pelvic floor may have aided fetal rotation.One trial did not report this outcome (Bahmaei 2018). The evidence suggests use of lateral posture may result in little or no di erence in the duration of labour compared to other postures (average MD -0.Severe perineal tears (third degree or higher, as defined by trialists) The evidence is very uncertain about the e ect of lateral postures compared to other postures on the outcome severe perineal tears because the CI is compatible with a wide range of e ects encompassing both appreciable benefit and also harm (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.17 to 2.48; Chi 2 = 0.92 (P = 0.63), I The use of lateral postures may result in little or no di erence in maternal satisfaction compared to use of other postures, but the evidence is uncertain (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.09; Chi 2 = 0.81 (P = 0.37), I 2 = 0%; 2 trials (Bahmaei 2018; Le Ray 2016), 451 women; lowcertainty evidence; Analysis 2.12).In the Bahmaei 2018 study, the intervention group had two arms: hands and knees posture, as reported in Comparison 1, and lateral (semi-prone) posture, as reported here.One trial only reported P values for two questions using the Mackey Scale (Bueno-Lopez 2018), and two trials did not report this outcome (Desbriere 2013; Liu 2018). No trials in the lateral posture comparison reported occipitotransverse arrest, epidural use, postnatal depression, any breastfeeding on discharge, and the long-term outcomes of operative pelvic floor repair post discharge or post-traumatic stress referrals.For one trial (Bueno-Lopez 2018), having an epidural was an inclusion criteria, and in another, the vast majority of women had an epidural prior to randomisation (Desbriere 2013). One trial with 210 participants reported no deaths in either group in the lateral posture comparison (Liu 2018), but the evidence is very uncertain. The evidence is very uncertain about the e ect of lateral postures compared to other postures on the outcome Apgar score less than seven at five minutes because the CI is compatible with a wide range of e ects encompassing both appreciable benefit and also Two trials used same-side-as-fetus lateral posture (Bueno-Lopez 2018; Desbriere 2013). Operative birth (composite outcome defined as caesarean section, instrumental vaginal birth) Same-side lateral posture may have little or no e ect on the rate of operative birth, compared to other postures (average RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.21; Tau 2 = 0.02, Chi 2 = 1.54 (P = 0.21), I 2 = 35%; 2 trials, 339 women; Analysis 3.1), but the evidence is very uncertain.The two trials di ered by intervention.Bueno-Lopez 2018 compared a same-side lateral posture in which the upper leg was slightly internally rotated (modified Sims) and a er fetal rotation, women adopted free postures.Desbriere 2013 compared a series of lateral postures on the same side as the fetus, depending on the station of the fetal head, and a er fetal rotation, adopted supine posture. The evidence is very uncertain about the e ect of same-side lateral posture compared to other postures on the outcome serious neonatal morbidity because the CI is compatible with a wide range of e ects encompassing both appreciable benefit and also harm, and the evidence was from one trial reporting infants\\' requirement for admission to neonatal intensive care (Desbriere 2013) (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.51 to 7.80; 220 women and their babies; Analysis 3.10).One trial did not report on this outcome (Bueno-Lopez 2018). Fetal malposition (OP/OT) a er the intervention Use of same-side lateral posture may have little or no e ect on fetal malposition (OP/OT) a er the intervention compared to other postures (average RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.07; Tau 2 = 0.04, Chi 2 = 1.95 (P = 0.16), I 2 = 49%; 2 trials, 339 women; Analysis 3.2), but the evidence is very uncertain.However, the trials di ered in that Bueno-Lopez 2018 confirmed anterior rotation by scan whereas Desbriere 2013 only reported persistent fetal position at birth.Though Desbriere 2013 had women in the study group adopt the supine position a er anterior rotation, they did not report on malposition just prior to this. Use of same-side lateral posture likely results in little or no di erence in duration of labour compared to the use of other postures, though the evidence is from only one trial (Desbriere 2013) (MD 0.13, 95% CI -0.56 to 0.82; 220 women; Analysis 3.3).Duration of labour was reported as median and interquartile range which we converted into mean and standard deviation.One trial did not report this outcome (Bueno-Lopez 2018). Only one trial reported oxytocin augmentation of labour (Desbriere 2013), in which there was likely little or no di erence between the same-side lateral posture and other posture groups (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.02; 220 women; Analysis 3.4).The Bueno-Lopez 2018 trial did not report on oxytocin augmentation. OP/OT position at birth was only reported in one trial of 220 women (Desbriere 2013), in which the same-side lateral posture may have had little or no e ect on OP/OT position at birth compared to other postures (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.50; Analysis 3.5).One study did not report fetal position at birth (Bueno-Lopez 2018). The evidence is very uncertain about the e ect of same-side lateral posture compared to other postures on the outcome caesarean section because the CI is compatible with a wide range of e ects encompassing both appreciable benefit and also harm (average RR 0.75, CI 0.33 to 1.69; Tau 2 = 0.24, Chi 2 = 3.25 (P = 0.07), I 2 = 69%; 2 trials, 339 women; Analysis 3.6).The two trial interventions di ered, which possibly explains the heterogeneity.Bueno-Lopez 2018 included slight internal rotation of the upper leg and Desbriere 2013 had women adopt a supine posture a er fetal rotation occurred. Rates of instrumental vaginal births may be no di erent between the same-side lateral posture groups and other posture groups (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.53; I 2 = 0%; 2 trials, 339 women; Analysis 3.7). Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. The number of women receiving an episiotomy may be no di erent using same-side lateral postures compared to other postures (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.41; I 2 = 0%; 2 trials, 339 women; Analysis 3.8). Severe perineal tears (third degree or higher, as defined by trialists) The evidence is very uncertain about the e ect of same-side lateral postures compared to other postures on the outcome severe perineal tears because the CI is compatible with a wide range of e ects encompassing both appreciable benefit and also harm (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.06 to 2.89; Chi 2 = 0.62 (P = 0.43), I 2 = 0%; 2 trials, 339 women; Analysis 3.9). Neither trial in the same-side lateral posture comparison reported pain score, occipito-transverse arrest, postpartum haemorrhage, epidural use, maternal satisfaction, postnatal depression, any breastfeeding on discharge, or the long-term outcomes of operative pelvic floor repair post discharge or post-traumatic stress referrals. Both trials reported epidural use prior to the intervention (Bueno-Lopez 2018; Desbriere 2013).In the Bueno-Lopez 2018 trial, all included women had epidural analgesia.In the Desbriere 2013 trial, 103 of 110 women in the intervention group and 105 of 110 women in the control group had an epidural. Neither trial in the same-side lateral posture comparison reported neonatal death. Neither trial in the same-side-lateral posture comparison reported Apgar scores less than seven at five minutes. The evidence is very uncertain about the e ect of same-side lateral postures compared to other postures on the outcome admission to neonatal intensive care because the CI is compatible with a wide range of e ects encompassing both appreciable benefit and also harm, and the evidence was from one trial with few events (Desbriere 2013) (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.51 to 7.80; 220 women and their babies; Analysis 3.11).The Bueno-Lopez 2018 trial did not report on this outcome. Only the Desbriere 2013 trial reported birth trauma, with just one incident of infant scalp trauma following a ventouse extraction delivery in the other posture group (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.09; 220 women and their babies; Analysis 3.12).Therefore, there were insu icient data to determine the e ect of posture on this outcome.One trial did not report this outcome (Bueno-Lopez 2018). No trials in the same-side lateral posture comparison reported death (stillbirth or death of liveborn infant), Apgar scores less than seven at five minutes, neonatal encephalopathy, need for respiratory support, neonatal jaundice requiring phototherapy, increased cord lactates or low pH, and the long-term outcome of disability including developmental delay. Two trials used a contralateral posture (Le Ray 2016; Liu 2018). Operative birth (composite outcome defined as caesarean section, instrumental vaginal birth) The evidence is very uncertain about the e ect of a contralateral posture compared to other postures on the outcome operative birth because the CI is compatible with a wide range of e ects encompassing both appreciable benefit and also harm (average RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.08 to 2.85; Tau 2 = 1.53,Chi 2 = 18.63 (P < 0.001), I 2 = 95%; 2 trials, 532 women; Analysis 4.1).Whilst both trials involved hip hyperflexion greater than 90 degrees, Liu 2018 randomised late in labour and thus applied the intervention closer to the time of birth. Serious neonatal morbidity (composite outcome defined as death, admission to neonatal intensive care, neonatal encephalopathy, or as defined by trialists) The evidence is very uncertain about the e ect of contralateral postures compared to other postures on the outcome serious neonatal morbidity because the CI is compatible with a wide range of e ects encompassing both appreciable benefit and also harm (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.43 to 3.12; 2 trials, 532 women and their babies; Analysis 4.12).Le Ray 2016 reported admission to neonatal intensive care, and Liu 2018 reported no deaths in either group. The evidence is very uncertain about the e ect of contralateral postures compared to other postures on the outcome fetal malposition (OP/OT) a er the intervention because the CI is compatible with a wide range of e ects encompassing both appreciable benefit and also harm (average RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.94; Tau 2 = 0.64, Chi 2 = 15.28 (P < 0.001), I 2 = 93%; 2 trials, 525 women; Analysis 4.2).The Liu 2018 study randomised women late in labour, when fetal rotation may have been aided by resistance of the pelvic floor in the second stage, which may explain the heterogeneity. The contralateral posture (with extreme hip flexion) likely reduced the duration of labour by 46 minutes compared to other postures (MD -0.76, 95% CI -1.14 to -0.38; overall e ect P < 0.001; 210 women; Analysis 4.3).However, the evidence was from only one trial (Liu 2018), so should be considered cautiously.One trial did not report duration of labour (Le Ray 2016). Pain score (as defined by trialists using standardised tools) Pain score was reported by only one trial (Le Ray 2016), which may have observed little or no di erence in mean pain score between the two groups (contralateral posture and other posture) (MD 0.10, 95% CI -0.28 to 0.48; 1 trial; 322 women; Analysis 4.4).One trial did not report on pain score (Liu 2018). The evidence is very uncertain about the e ect of contralateral posture compared to other postures on the outcome OP/OT Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews position at birth because the CI is compatible with a wide range of e ects encompassing both appreciable benefit and also harm (average RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.08 to 2.89; Tau 2 = 1.51,Chi 2 = 14.15 (P < 0.001), I 2 = 93%; 2 trials, 529 women; Analysis 4.5).The Liu 2018 trial attempted manual rotation on all women for whom postural correction was unsuccessful 60 minutes a er randomisation, and the Le Ray 2016 trial performed manual rotation prior to instrumental vaginal birth. The evidence is very uncertain about the e ect of contralateral postures compared to other postures on the outcome caesarean section because the CI is compatible with a wide range of e ects encompassing both appreciable benefit and also harm (average RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.17 to 2.86; Tau 2 = 0.83, Chi 2 = 4.45 (P = 0.03), I 2 = 78%; 2 trials, 532 women; Analysis 4.6).Whilst both trial interventions incorporated hip hyperflexion greater than 90 degrees, the Liu 2018 trial applied the intervention closer to the time of birth, and performed instrumental vaginal delivery or caesarean section if manual rotation was unsuccessful 60 minutes a er the intervention.Manual rotation was performed successfully in six of 13 women in the study group but only one of 36 women in the control group.These factors may explain the heterogeneity seen in this comparison. The evidence is very uncertain about the e ect of contralateral postures compared to other postures on the outcome instrumental vaginal birth because the CI is compatible with a wide range of e ects encompassing both appreciable benefit and also harm (average RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.07 to 2.76; Tau 2 = 1.66,Chi 2 = 11.49(P < 0.001), I 2 = 91%; 2 trials, 532 women; Analysis 4.7).All women in the Liu 2018 trial with an unsuccessful postural correction received manual rotation 60 minutes a er the intervention, whilst manual rotation was only performed in the Le Ray 2016 trial prior to instrumental vaginal birth; this di erence may explain the heterogeneity. There may be little or no di erence in women\\'s risk of episiotomy using contralateral postures compared to other postures (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.20; 270 women; Analysis 4.8); however, the evidence is from only one trial (Le Ray 2016).The Liu 2018 trial did not report on episiotomy. Severe perineal tears (third degree or higher, as defined by trialists) The evidence is very uncertain about the e ect of contralateral postures compared to other postures on the outcome severe perineal tears because the CI is compatible with a wide range of e ects encompassing both appreciable benefit and also harm, and the evidence is from only one trial with very few events (Le Ray 2016) (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.15 to 7.42; 270 women; Analysis 4.9).The Liu 2018 trial did not report on perineal tears. The evidence is very uncertain about the e ect of contralateral postures compared to other postures on the outcome postpartum haemorrhage because the CI is compatible with a wide range of e ects encompassing both appreciable benefit and also harm, and evidence is from only one trial (Le Ray 2016) (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.70; 322 women; Analysis 4.10).The Liu 2018 trial did not report on postpartum haemorrhage. Women using contralateral postures or other postures were likely equally satisfied in terms of comfort with their allocated posture; however, the evidence was from only one trial (Le Ray 2016) (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.12; 322 women; Analysis 4.11).The Liu 2018 trial did not report maternal satisfaction. Neither trial in the contralateral posture comparison reported oxytocin augmentation, epidural use, occipito-transverse arrest, postnatal depression, any breastfeeding on discharge, and the long-term outcomes of operative pelvic floor repair post discharge and post-traumatic stress referrals. Death (stillbirth or death of liveborn infant) One trial with 210 participants reported no deaths in either group in the contralateral comparison (Liu 2018). The evidence is very uncertain about the e ect of contralateral postures compared to other postures on the outcome Apgar score less than seven at five minutes because the CI is compatible with a wide range of e ects encompassing both appreciable benefit and also harm, and the evidence is from only one trial (Le Ray 2016) (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.24; 322 women and their babies; Analysis 4.13).The Liu 2018 trial reported Apgar scores inclusive of seven. The evidence is very uncertain about the e ect of contralateral postures compared to other postures on the outcome admission to neonatal intensive care because the CI is compatible with a wide range of e ects encompassing both appreciable benefit and also harm, and the evidence is from only one trial (Le Ray 2016) (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.43 to 3.12; 322 women and their babies; Analysis 4.14).The Liu 2018 trial did not report neonatal admissions to intensive care. Neither trial in the contralateral posture comparison reported on neonatal encephalopathy, need for respiratory support, neonatal jaundice requiring phototherapy, increased cord lactates or low pH, birth trauma, or the long-term outcome of disability including developmental delay. In this review, we included eight randomised trials of maternal posture reporting on 1766 women with fetal malposition in labour. We did not restrict inclusion of studies based on language.We had two included studies translated into English (Bahmaei 2018; Molina-Reyes 2014). Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Use of the hands and knees posture may have little or no e ect on the primary maternal outcome operative birth (a composite outcome defined as caesarean section or instrumental vaginal birth), and for caesarean section alone, but the evidence is uncertain.Use of the hands and knees posture may have little or no e ect on the secondary outcomes epidural use, instrumental vaginal birth, severe perineal tears, and maternal satisfaction, but the evidence is very uncertain (Summary of findings 1).The evidence is very uncertain about the e ect of the hands and knees posture on Apgar score less than seven at five minutes (Summary of findings 2).No data were available for postpartum haemorrhage, serious neonatal morbidity, death (stillbirth or death of liveborn infant), admission to neonatal intensive care, neonatal encephalopathy, need for respiratory support, and neonatal jaundice requiring phototherapy. Use of lateral postures, including same-side and contralateral postures, may have little or no e ect on the primary maternal outcome operative birth, whether a caesarean section or instrumental vaginal birth, and the secondary outcomes maternal satisfaction, caesarean section, and instrumental vaginal birth, but the evidence is uncertain.Use of lateral postures may have little or no e ect on the secondary outcomes severe perineal tears and postpartum haemorrhage, but the evidence is very uncertain (Summary of findings 3).For the infant, the evidence is very uncertain about the e ect of lateral postures on the primary outcome serious neonatal morbidity, and secondary outcomes Apgar score less than seven at five minutes, admission to neonatal intensive care, and death (stillbirth or death of liveborn infant) (Summary of findings 4).There were no data reported for epidural use, neonatal encephalopathy, need for respiratory support, and neonatal jaundice requiring phototherapy. Little to no di erences in e ect were observed for the remaining maternal and infant secondary outcomes for which there were data; however, the evidence was uncertain.Each maternal posture comparison utilised a variety of comparators.This may have minimised the pooled treatment e ect, especially where trial comparators had di ering mechanisms of rotation.Di erences by timing, duration, and posture may have also influenced the findings. The evidence from the meta-analysis on the e ectiveness of maternal postures for fetal malpositon in labour remains inconclusive.Whether either of the broad posture categories adopted within this review -that is, hands and knees posture or lateral postures -generate mechanisms for fetal rotation, or subtle di erences within the postures, such as hip hyperflexion or slight internal rotation of the upper leg, make a di erence is unclear.None of the included trials reported data for the key review outcomes of occipito-transverse arrest, any breastfeeding at discharge, operative pelvic floor repair post discharge, posttraumatic stress referrals, neonatal encephalopathy, need for respiratory support, neonatal jaundice requiring phototherapy, increased lactates (as defined by trialists) or low pH (as defined by trialists), and disability including long-term developmental delay (as defined by trialists).Evidence was based on one trial for several outcomes or was only reported for some postures.Several trials had a short duration of intervention which may be insu icient time to assess the e ectiveness of that posture in labour for fetal malposition.All trials but one reporting maternal satisfaction had both nulliparous and multiparous women; the exception was Bahmaei 2018. None of the trials reported any data that we could use for the pre-specified subgroup comparisons or had other conditions that warranted the application of our pre-specified subgroup analysis.It is therefore not known whether di erent findings may have resulted from analyses of the planned subgroups of parity, body mass index (less than 25 versus greater than or equal to 25), birthweight (less than 90 th centile versus greater than or equal to 90 th centile), fetal position (le OP/OT versus right OP/OT), and level of care facility (primary versus secondary or tertiary facility), and malposition confirmed by ultrasound. There were no trials of postures other than the hands and knees or lateral postures.Only one study utilised the semi-prone lateral posture and only reported on maternal satisfaction. It is possible that interventions of short duration early in labour could be susceptible to a recurrence of malrotation a er cessation of the posture, and therefore impact on the outcome \\'OP/OT position at birth\\'.Current guidelines recommend nonsupine positions in labour and freedom of maternal position and movement throughout labour (World Health Organization 1996) . The evidence from this review does not support a change to these recommendations.Two prospective cohort studies reported over two-thirds of fetuses malrotate during labour (Gardberg 1998; Lieberman 2005) , although other studies report the contrary (Souka 2003; Akmal 2004 ).Whether the fetal spine is anterior or remains transverse a er anterior rotation of the head may be a determining factor.Malrotation following postural correction may explain the substantial heterogeneity in all lateral posture comparisons containing the Liu 2018 trial which di ered from the other trials by having randomisation late in labour, with use of the posture in the second stage of labour.One trial using contralateral posture, Le Ray 2016, and one trial using hands and knees posture, Guittier 2016, stopped the postural intervention before the second stage of labour, which may explain the lack of e ect seen in these trials.Another trial using the same-side lateral posture did not report when women stopped using the posture (Desbriere 2013). How trials reported maternal satisfaction varied, including satisfaction with the labour experience, satisfaction with the posture, and level of control in labour.Had all trials measured satisfaction with the posture, there may have been greater clarity on how women viewed use of posture for malposition in labour. The heterogeneity may relate to one study di ering by parity.Nulliparous women who typically experience a longer labour may have less tolerance for discomfort using the hands and knees posture, which has been reported to lead to sore wrists, hips, ligaments, and back pain (Kariminia 2004). Epidural use is an important outcome, considering women are more likely to experience backache with a fetal malposition (Stremler 2003).However, there was a paucity of data concerning Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews epidural use, partly due to women already having an epidural at randomisation. The body of evidence is generated from eight trials reporting on 1766 women.Conclusions about the e ectiveness of maternal posture to improve maternal and infant health following fetal malposition in labour are limited by insu icient sample sizes and too few trials able to provide data for many of the outcomes, except operative birth (lateral posture).Inconsistency due to substantial statistical heterogeneity was apparent for three outcomes within the hands and knees comparison (epidural use, instrumental vaginal birth, and maternal satisfaction), and two outcomes within the lateral posture comparison (operative birth (primary outcome) and caesarean section), limiting the certainty of the evidence. Several trials had short periods for the intervention of only 30 to 60 minutes, with one trial having only a 10-minute minimum period (Guittier 2016).This could have potentially reduced the e ect size for birth outcomes, considering the wide interval of time for confounding by other postures before the birth.One trial of the hands and knees posture assessed malposition in some women by clinical vaginal examination (Molina-Reyes 2014), known to be less accurate than ultrasound assessment (Souka 2003; Akmal 2004 ).This trial had a 14.5% attrition due to women being unable to maintain the posture following epidural analgesia.The trial compared the hands and knees posture to same-side lateral posture which both have hypotheses for rotation based on gravity, possibly neutralising e ects.Due to the nature of labour care, all trials were unblinded, thus at high risk of performance bias.In one trial that used the contralateral posture (Liu 2018), successful manual rotation followed by eutocic birth occurred in six of 13 women in the posture group but only one of 36 women in the control group, suggesting risk of performance bias for the review\\'s primary outcome operative birth. The certainty of the evidence was low for all maternal outcomes in the hands and knees posture comparison except epidural use, instrumental vaginal birth, and severe perineal tears, which we judged to be of very low certainty (Summary of findings 1).We downgraded operative birth, epidural use, caesarean section, instrumental vaginal birth, and maternal satisfaction one level for serious limitations in study design due to a high risk of performance bias in all studies; one of the included studies was at high risk of selection bias, detection bias, attrition bias, and reporting bias (not intention-to-treat analysis).We downgraded severe perineal tears one level for serious risk of performance bias in both studies, and one level for serious imprecision due to low event rate and small sample size with very wide confidence interval; we downgraded all other outcomes one level for serious imprecision due to small sample size.We downgraded all outcomes except operative birth and caesarean section one level for serious inconsistency due to substantial unexplained statistical heterogeneity.There were no data available to report on postpartum haemorrhage.We judged the outcome Apgar scores less than seven at five minutes to be of very low-certainty evidence (Summary of findings 2), downgrading by one level due to risk of performance bias in all trials; selection bias, detection bias, attrition bias, and reporting bias (not intention-to-treat analysis) in one trial; and downgrading by two levels for very serious imprecision due to low event rate, small sample size, and very wide confidence interval. For the lateral posture comparison, we assessed the certainty of the evidence as low for operative birth, caesarean section, instrumental vaginal birth, and maternal satisfaction; and very low for severe perineal tears and postpartum haemorrhage.We downgraded operative birth, caesarean section, and instrumental vaginal birth by one level for serious limitations in study design due to a high risk of performance bias in all studies, detection bias in one study, and reporting bias (not intention-to-treat analysis) in one study; and downgraded by one further level for serious inconsistency due to substantial unexplained statistical heterogeneity (Summary of findings 3).We downgraded severe perineal tears and postpartum haemorrhage by one level for imprecision due to low event rate, small sample size, and very wide confidence interval.We further downgraded one level for serious limitations in study design due to high risk of performance bias in all studies; detection bias in one study; and reporting bias in one study applied to severe perineal tears.We downgraded maternal satisfaction by one level for serious imprecision due to small sample size; and one level due to serious limitations in study design due to a high risk of performance bias in both studies, and detection bias in one study.We judged all infant outcomes reported to be of very low-certainty evidence (Summary of findings 4).We downgraded all outcomes one level for serious limitations in study design due to a high risk of performance bias in all studies.Detection bias in one study applied to the outcomes Apgar score less than seven at five minutes and admission to neonatal intensive care; and reporting bias (no intention-to-treat analysis) applied to the outcome death (stillbirth or death of liveborn infant).We downgraded by two further levels the outcomes serious neonatal morbidity, Apgar scores less than seven at five minutes, and admission to neonatal intensive care for very serious imprecision due to low event rate, small sample size, and very wide confidence intervals.We further downgraded the outcome death (stillbirth or death of liveborn infant) two levels for very serious imprecision due to it being a single small study with no events. The review has the following strengths.We included all eligible relevant trials identified by the search and considered trustworthy.At least two review authors (JB and either JH, LL, BK or CC) agreed upon all data extraction and synthesis.At least two review authors held regular meetings, and all the review authors held monthly meetings, to reach agreement on the review\\'s approach, such as organisation of comparisons, GRADE evaluations, interpretation of the results, and the implications for practice and research.The review author group sought a third opinion to reach agreement on risk of bias in two trials.In addition, the review benefits from author backgrounds in midwifery, obstetrics, general medicine, statistics, and clinical trials, providing contextual insight, for example, on the risk of performance bias in the clinical setting, and implications relevant to clinical practice and research. However, the review needs to be considered in the light of some limitations.Three trials remain awaiting classification due to the need for further information from the trial authors.Despite searching, we found no email address for authors of two of these trials (Ou 1997; Lu 2001 ), and we have received no response as Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews yet from Wu 2001.We have received no response as yet to a request for additional information about randomisation method from Bahmaei 2018 (hands and knees comparison).Most of the trials had relatively small sample sizes; consequently, much of the evidence is uncertain due to imprecision. The previous Cochrane Review of the use of hands and knees posture in labour compared with control posture analysed the data from Stremler 2005 (Hunter 2007 ).The review reported no di erences in comparison of operative birth, persistent malposition including at delivery, perineal trauma and Apgar scores, similar to the findings in this review apart from the definition used for Apgar scores. Two recently published systematic reviews provide meta-analyses assessing maternal posture to correct fetal malposition (Lee 2021; Levy 2021).The Levy 2021 review of trials of the hands and knees posture included pregnancy and labour trials but presented a subgroup analysis of women in labour.Lee 2021 assessed posture during the first stage of labour and included trials that used the hands and knees posture and trials using lateral postures.Lee 2021 hypothesised that both postures entail flexion of the thigh to 90 degrees or higher to the axis of the maternal spine, a mechanism by which the authors suggest pelvic diameters are increased, encouraging fetal rotation. Our meta-analysis used random-e ects analysis where heterogeneity exceeded 30%, compared to greater than 50% in the case of Lee 2021, and consistent use of random-e ects analysis in the case of Levy 2021.Regardless of how these two systematic reviews di er from this Cochrane Review in terms of pooled participants, interventions, or statistical model, their findings chime with our findings that there was little to no di erence between the posture and control groups in the pooled analysis for most outcomes. Similar We found low-and very low-certainty evidence which indicated that the use of hands and knees posture or lateral postures in women in labour with a fetal malposition may have little or no e ect on health outcomes of the mother or her infant.There was insu icient data to be able to assess most of these comparisons.If women find the use of hands and knees or lateral postures in labour comfortable, there is no reason why they should not choose to use them. Further research is needed on the use of hands and knees and lateral postures for women with a malposition in labour.This will improve precision through analyses of larger sample sizes, to be able to detect potentially important di erences in interventions, such as semi-prone inclination and hip hyperflexion.Trials should include further assessment of semi-prone postures and/or sameside-as-fetus lateral postures with or without hip hyperflexion.Future trials that assess a longer intervention period or shorter interval between the intervention and birth, may result in greater frequency of events and provide further evidence that is needed.Consideration should be given to longer duration interventions, perhaps including a minimum duration per hour rather than per labour, and assessment of the use of maternal posture in the second stage of labour.Free posture comparators are preferable to avoid possible confounding from hypothetical mechanisms of rotation within a comparator.Ultrasonic confirmation of fetal malposition prior to randomisation and at assessment of fetal position post intervention by an assessor masked to treatment group should be considered. How women felt about the postures needs further study as data are currently limited.Epidural use is an important outcome to report to provide contextual information on maternal pain scores.Future trials should report on all clinically relevant infant outcomes, including neonatal encephalopathy, need for respiratory support, and neonatal jaundice requiring phototherapy, as none of the current trials provided information about these.None of the existing trials have reported any longer-term outcomes prespecified in this review, such as post-traumatic stress referrals, need for pelvic floor repair for the women, and childhood disability including developmental delay.These should be considered in future trials.

Methods RCT Setting: a tertiary care centre maternity unit -Hôpital Nord, Marseille, France Inclusion criteria: those eligible had provided written, informed consent prior to randomisation and were adult pregnant women (age ≥ 18 years) in labour at ≥ 36 weeks of gestation, with cervical dilatation of ≥ 3 cm and ruptured membranes, and with a single fetus in cephalic OP position confirmed by ultrasound examination.Gestational age calculation was based on the participant\\'s reported last menstrual period and fetal biometry at first-trimester systematic ultrasound scan. Experimental intervention: a sequence of postures was adopted depending on the station of the fetal head: posture 1 used the hands and knees posture when fetal head station between -5 and -3; posture 2 used a strict lateral recumbent position on the same side of the fetal spine with folded inferior leg and upper leg positioned in the axis of the body when fetal head station between -2 and 0; posture 3 used a lateral recumbent position on the same side of the fetal spine, with the inferior leg lying in the axis of the body and the other leg folded at an approximately 90-degree angle with the use of a leg support when fetal head station > 0. Women who achieved anterior rotation were then asked to adopt the dorsal recumbent position.Total number randomised: n = 110 Control/comparison intervention: dorsal recumbent position.Total number randomised: n = 110 Outcomes Primary: fetal head position at spontaneous vaginal delivery, or immediately before operative vaginal delivery or caesarean section Secondary: length of labour, length of pushing, operative deliveries, caesarean sections, perineal lacerations (Anglo-Saxon classification), oxytocin use, neonatal morbidity (Apgar score at 5 minutes, Apgar score at 10 minutes, umbilical arterial pH) and neonatal intensive care unit stay.

Methods RCT Setting: a randomised, open, controlled, and multicentre clinical trial was designed in three hospitals of the public network of Andalusia, in the hospitals of Baza and Guadix, in Granada, and Úbedaenjaén. Study dates: 01 January 2010 to 30 June 2011 • Pregnant women in the active phase of childbirth and diagnosed with persistent OP fetal position • Diagnosis of the fetal position made by the midwife who attended to the pregnant woman by performing a vaginal examination • Persistent OP was considered when the fetus had not rotated to OA and the dilation of the cervix was equal to or greater than 8 cm or a lower dilation without progression of labour for at least 2 hours with adequate uterine dynamics (3 to 5 contractions in 10 minutes). • Pregnant women with a single fetus greater than 37 weeks of gestation, who met the conditions of the definition of the study subjects and agreed to participate voluntarily in the study. Exclusion criteria: maternal or fetal causes that prevented the intervention (active metrorrhagia, indication of urgent caesarean section due to fetal suffering), non-adoption of the assigned posture due to loss of muscle strength in lower limbs secondary to the administration of epidural analgesia, or twin pregnancies. Experimental intervention: the women adopted the hands and knees position on the bed.They were given the option to support their hands on the mattress, their forearms on the bed\\'s headboard, or their thorax on a ball such as a \"fit-ball\" type.The assigned posture was to be maintained for a minimum of 30 minutes, if the fetus had not yet rotated to OA.After the intervention, the woman could adopt any position she wanted.Total number randomised: n = 76. Control/comparison intervention: the decubitus lateral (DL) posture towards the fetal back, lying on their right side when the fetus was in the right OP position and on their le side if the fetus was in the le OP position or direct OP.If after 30 minutes, the fetus had not rotated from direct OP to OA, they would adopt the right DL.The assigned posture was to be maintained for a minimum of 30 minutes, if the fetus had not yet rotated to OA.After the intervention, the woman could adopt any position she wanted.Total number randomised: n = 70. Fetal rotation from OP to OA (rotation during the intervention, rotation after the intervention, non-rotation); type of termination of delivery (normal vaginal delivery, instrumental delivery, caesarean section); duration of the intervention (minutes), duration of the first stage of labour (minutes), duration of the second stage of labour (minutes); epidural use; and satisfaction with birth experience using the Care in Obstetrics: Measure for Testing Satisfaction (COMFORTS) Scale -very dissatisfied, dissatisfied, moderately satisfied recoded as unsatisfied, and satisfied, very satisfied recoded as satisfied; pain level during the adoption of the given posture compared to pain before adopting it (less, equal, greater); comfort with assigned posture (very comfortable, moderately comfortable, comfortable were recoded as comfortable, and very uncomfortable, uncomfortable were recoded as uncomfortable).

Selective reporting (reporting bias) Low risk It seems that all outcomes specified have been reported. No other bias identified. Methods RCT Setting: 13 university-affiliated hospitals in Argentina, Australia, Canada, England, Israel, and the USA Study dates: 28-month period in 2000 to 2002. Inclusion criteria: in hospital, in early or active labour with a singleton pregnancy in cephalic presentation at ≥ 37 weeks\\' gestation, with occipito-posterior position of the fetal head confirmed by ultrasound examination. Exclusion criteria: second stage of labour expected within 1 hour, complications of pregnancy or any other contraindication to assuming hands and knees position (such as immobilising anaesthesia), planned caesarean delivery, or known major fetal congenital anomalies. Experimental intervention: women assigned to the hands and knees position were asked to maintain the posture for as much time as possible over a period of 60 minutes, for a minimum of 30 minutes in total.After the study period, the woman was encouraged to use the hands and knees position whenever she wished for the remainder of labour.Total number randomised: n = 70. Control/Comparison intervention: women were able to use any position except hands and knees position or any position that suspended the maternal abdomen.Women were asked not to assume hands and knees position at any time during the study period and were not actively encouraged to use this position at any other time in labour.Clinicians who placed the telephone call to obtain group allocation were not permitted to perform the final ultrasound scan to determine the primary outcome.Nurses, midwives, and labouring women were instructed not to reveal group assignments to the clinician performing the final ultrasound examination, and clinicians were asked not to seek out the labouring woman\\'s assignment.Although the clinician may also have provided care to the labouring woman, it was rare that the woman needed to be assessed during the short interval between ultrasound scans.Forms were sealed so that the clinician recording the ultrasound results was unable to access data sheets indicating the woman\\'s group assignment and pain scores.Research assistants collecting data from chart review and scanning data into the computer database were unaware of group allocation.

The e ects of HIV-related DSP can be debilitating.Most a ected individuals experience severe neuropathic pain.In patients with involvement of the feet, around 30% have moderate pain, while this proportion climbs to 50% with more proximal involvement (Schifitto 2005) .Studies report that even mild neuropathic pain could be associated with significant impact on quality of life, besides a ecting employment opportunities (Biraguma 2012; Ellis 2010; Keltner 2012) .The e ects of HIV-related DSP on disability and functional impairment have also been well documented (Pandya 2005; Ellis 2010 ).Presence of pain has also been associated with higher scores for depression, anxiety and insomnia (Phillips 2014; Pillay 2018 ). HIV-related DSP is a length-dependent, axonal, predominantly sensory neuropathy, dominated by neuropathic pain.Clinical examination may reveal increased vibratory and pinprick thresholds, reduced or absent ankle reflexes, and minimal distal weakness.Another entity that is usually considered along with HIV-related DSP is antiretroviral toxic neuropathy (ATN), that is practically indistinguishable from the former.In the early years following introduction of Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART), zalcitabine, stavudine and didanosine (dideoxynucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors; d-NRTIs) accounted for most cases of ATN (Berger 1993; Blum 1996) .Development of sensory neuropathy in an antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive HIV-infected person supports a diagnosis of HIV-related DSP; a temporal association with initiation of ART is probably the most important distinguishing feature of ATN.In case of ATN, symptoms typically occur one week to six months a er commencing these antiretroviral drugs and may worsen for a period of time even a er discontinuation, a phenomenon known as \\'coasting\\', which also occurs in other toxic neuropathies (Berger 1993; Blum 1996) . The prevalence of HIV-related DSP steadily increased from 7.5% to 13% in the early 1990s when HAART was sparingly used (Fuller 1993; Smyth 2007 ), to around 42% in 2006 (Smyth 2007) .Despite a decline in use of d-NRTIs and widespread availability of newer ART with favourable safety profiles, the burden of HIV-related DSP is increasing.The current estimated prevalence of HIV-related DSP varies from 1.2% to 69.4%, depending upon disease stage and concurrent antiretroviral therapy (Ghosh 2012) .Further, the risk factors associated with HIV-related DSP have shi ed significantly from advanced HIV infection, lower CD4 T lymphocyte count and higher viral load in the pre-HAART era (Bacellar 1994; Barohn 1993; Childs 1999; Husstedt 2000; Simpson 2002) , to advanced age, taller height, exposure to d-NRTIs (stavudine in particular), diabetes and current exposure to combination ART (CART) in the HAART era (Cherry 2006; Ellis 2010; Evans 2011) .Apart from these, data also implicate protease inhibitor (PI) use as a risk for developing HIVrelated DSP while on d-NRTIs (Evans 2011; Pettersen 2006) , despite some contradicting evidence (Ellis 2008) .Therefore, contrary to logical expectations, HIV-related DSP (including ATN) is still a huge public health concern, justifying need for ongoing studies to address both knowledge gaps and potential disease-modifying treatments. The exact pathogenesis of HIV-related DSP is unknown.Both direct and indirect mechanisms have been proposed; these include direct axonal toxicity induced by the HIV envelope glycoprotein gp120, and aberrant pro-inflammatory cytokine-mediated neurotoxicity, indirectly caused by HIV through macrophage activation (Keltner 2012; Rizzuto 1995; Tyor 1995) .In contrast, pathophysiology of ATN has been attributed to direct mitochondrial toxicity (Dalakas 2001) . The first obvious choice of treatment in ATN is to discontinue use of neurotoxic drugs, which in people with HIV means changing their ART regimen.Symptoms can take many weeks to resolve a er drug discontinuation, if they resolve at all (Berger 1993) . Current management of both HIV-related DSP and ATN is largely symptomatic and focusses on pain relief.With better understanding of the pathophysiology of HIV-related DSP and ATN, research into agents that might have neuroregenerative properties is attracting more interest.The candidate disease-modifying drugs are peptide T, nerve growth factor (NGF), prosaptide, memantine, acetyl-Lcarnitine (ALC), and vicriviroc. Initially developed as a promising antiretroviral agent, peptide T is a synthetic octapeptide (Pert 1986) .Several phase I studies on peptide T in people with HIV infection reported improvement in neurological symptoms, including painful neuropathy (Bridge 1989; Wetterberg 1987) .NGF belongs to a group of proteins that enhance survival of sensory and sympathetic neurons by binding to specific receptors on the cell surface (Levi-Montalcini 1987) .Prosaptide, a synthetic glycoprotein belonging to the saposin group, has demonstrated benefit in animal models of neuropathy (Wagner 1998; Calcutt 2000) .Memantine is an analogue of amantadine, an antiviral drug.ALC is essential for normal mitochondrial function and has been reported to activate NGF receptors (Rampello 1992) .It may also promote peripheral nerve regeneration (McKay 2002) .Vicriviroc is an HIV cell-entry-blocker that specifically acts on the C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) co-receptor (Strizki 2005) . These disease-modifying drugs may produce beneficial e ects in HIV-related DSP and ATN through various mechanisms.Peptide T is a competitive inhibitor of gp120 binding to CD4 receptors (Brenneman 1988) .In addition, it binds to vasoactive intestinal peptide receptors (Pert 1988) .These actions may lead to disruption of cytokine production and function, and ultimately reduce inflammation and neurotoxicity (Kleinerman 1987) .NGF and prosaptide have neurotrophic properties (i.e.promote nerve growth).NGF has pleiotrophic properties in the developing and mature nervous systems (Sah 2003) .It is secreted at sites of damage in peripheral nerves, where it stimulates sprouting of Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews collateral nerves (Doubleday 1992) .In a phase II clinical trial, it improved nerve fibre function among diabetics with neuropathy (Apfel 1998) .Prosaptide, administered as a subcutaneous injection, is rapidly absorbed with a short half-life and has been e ective in experimental models of chemotherapy-induced and diabetic neuropathies (Calcutt 2000; Campana 1998) .The e ects are likely to be mediated through activation of lysosomal hydrolysis of sphingolipids (Harzer 2001) .Memantine became an attractive treatment option in HIV-related DSP or ATN a er the identification of the role of the NMDA receptor in pathogenesis of neuropathy.Memantine is an important mediator in the maintenance of chronic neuropathic pain (Chen 1992) .It decreases pain in animal models of chronic pain by acting as a non-competitive antagonist at the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors (Parsons 2001) .This analogue of amantadine, an antiviral drug, may also prevent neurotoxicity induced by Tat, platelet activating factor, and gp120 (Lipton 1992; Nath 2000; Toggas 1996) .ALC modulates cholinergic and glutaminergic neurons, thereby reducing acute and chronic pain, respectively (Chiechio 2002; Ghelardini 2002) .Moreover, ALC potentiates the actions of NGF (Jiang 2008) .In its non-acetylated form, carnitine may also have immunological actions in HIV infection (Famularo 1999) .In diabetic neuropathy, ALC improved electrophysiological parameters and pain scores (De Grandis 2002) .Vicriviroc may modulate the crucial role of CCR5 neuronal receptors in HIV-induced neurotoxicity (Keswani 2003) . A protocol for a Cochrane Review of treatment of pain in HIVrelated distal symmetrical polyneuropathy is currently under development.In addition, there is a protocol for a Cochrane Review in progress, \\'Nerve growth factors for neuropathic pain\\', which will also include the use of NGF for HIV-related neuropathy (Zhang 2017) .All these agents can theoretically play a disease-modifying role in DSP through various mechanisms, as described above.Currently we know of no systematic reviews of disease-modifying therapies for HIV-related DSP or ATN. Since the pathogeneses of HIV-related DSP and ATN are probably di erent, it might seem logical to restrict this review to people with HIV who have not been exposed to d-NRTIs or PIs.However, the interaction is more complex.ATN is more common in people with pre-existing HIV-related DSP, and symptoms and signs of a painful distal sensory neuropathy may persist despite discontinuation of d-NRTIs (Berger 1993) .It is also possible that ATN is, at least partially, an \\'unmasking\\' of clinically silent HIV-related DSP.Furthermore, HIV-related DSP and ATN frequently co-exist.Although the use of d-NRTIs in ART regimens has declined, ATN related to PIs continues to be an important cause of DSP (Evans 2011) , as mentioned earlier.Therefore, despite the di iculties inherent in evaluating the e ects of treatment in a potentially heterogeneous population, we will consider studies that include participants on d-NRTI or PIcontaining ART regimens, provided the main aim of the study is to investigate HIV-related DSP. To assess the disease-modifying e ects of treatments in people with HIV for HIV-related DSP (including ATN) compared with no treatment, placebo or other treatments. We will include all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of disease-modifying treatments for HIV-related DSP.Quasirandomised trials assign participants to treatments using methods that are partly systematic (for example, alternate allocation or allocation according to the day of the week), and so are potentially predictable. We will only include studies where the intervention is given for a minimum of three months.We have taken a cut-o of three months because any improvement early in the course of treatment is likely to be symptomatic, i.e. mostly pain relief, and not any diseasemodifying e ect of the drug.Moreover, management of pain in HIV-related DSP will be reviewed in another Cochrane Review in development.We will consider cross-over trials for inclusion.We will include eligible studies regardless of publication status or language. We will include participants of all ages who fulfil all of the following criteria (modified from Working Group of the American Academy of Neurology AIDS Task Force; AAN 1991). • HIV positive • Presence of distal sensory symptoms, such as pain, paraesthesiae and sensory loss • Either clinical evidence of a predominantly sensory DSP, such as sensory loss in a \\'stocking distribution\\', allodynia, impaired temperature perception, reduced or absent ankle reflexes, with minimal weakness; or electrophysiological evidence of an axonal, predominantly sensory, neuropathy.Other causes of peripheral neuropathy (such as diabetes, alcohol, and neurotoxic drugs other than d-NRTIs) need to have been excluded We will include all disease-modifying pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions in HIV-related DSP that target disease-specific pathophysiological processes or toxicity from ART, compared with no treatment, placebo, or other treatment agents. Primary outcomes • Neuropathy symptom improvement measured as change in Total Symptom Score (TSS) or other validated symptom score, preferably expressed as the change from baseline (Bastyr 2005; Ziegler 1995 ). • Health-related quality of life, measured as change in any validated quality of life score like SF 36 (Ware 1992) or EQ 5D (Rabin 2001) • Adverse events, specifically any adverse events, adverse events which lead to discontinuation of treatment, and serious adverse events, which are fatal, life-threatening, or requiring prolonged hospitalisation.We will consider adverse events in all included studies of any duration at any time.• Participant-reported pain relief of 30% or greater. • Participant-reported pain relief of 50% or greater. • Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) much or very much improved.• Electrophysiological changes: changes from baseline in amplitude, latency and conduction velocity of a sensory nerve (sural, median or ulnar sensory nerve) We prefer to express continuous outcomes as changes from baseline, but we will also collect endpoint values and determine which data provide the more complete data set.We will categorise all outcome measures into short-term (three to six months) and long-term (more than six months) time points.If su icient studies (at least two in each group) are not available in these categories we will combine these two groups during meta-analysis. We will search the databases listed below using the terms \\'HIV infections\\' or \\'HIV\\' or \\'AIDS\\' and \\'Polyneuropathies\\' or \\'Peripheral nervous system diseases\\' or \\'neuropathy\\' or \\'polyneuritis\\' or \\'distal symmetrical polyneuropathy\\' or \\'antiretroviral toxic neuropathy\\' as well as appropriate indexing terms and search strategies designed to identify randomised controlled trials. We will seek other published and unpublished trials by contacting the authors of any identified trials and other disease experts.We will search for studies in bibliographies from review articles retrieved by the searches and included studies. We will specifically search for errata or retractions of included studies. Two review authors (AB and VYV) will independently check the titles and abstracts of the articles retrieved by the search and code them as \\'retrieve\\' (eligible or potentially eligible/unclear) or \\'do not retrieve\\'; and two review authors (AB and VYV) will independently screen the full text and identify studies for inclusion, and identify and record reasons for exclusion of the ineligible studies using Covidence so ware (Covidence 2020).We will resolve any disagreement through discussion or, if required, we will consult a third person (KT).We will identify and exclude duplicates and collate multiple reports of the same study so that each study rather than each report is the unit of interest in the review.We will record the selection process in su icient detail to complete a PRISMA flow diagram and \\'Characteristics of excluded studies\\' table (Moher 2001) . Two review authors (AB and VYV) will independently extract data using a specially designed data extraction form.They will extract the following study characteristics from included studies in duplicate: study design and setting, characteristics of participants (e.g.disease severity and age), eligibility criteria, intervention details, the outcomes assessed, source(s) of study funding, and any conflicts of interest among investigators.They will resolve disagreements by discussion and a third review author (DF) will arbitrate any unsettled disputes.We will write to trial authors to obtain missing data if necessary. Two review authors (AB and VYV) will independently extract outcome data from included studies.We will note in the \\'Characteristics of included studies\\' table if outcome data were not reported in a usable way.One review author (VYV) will transfer data into Review Manager 5 (RevMan 5) (Review Manager 2020).Another author (RK) will check the outcome data entries.A third author (AB) will spot-check study characteristics for accuracy against the trial report. When reports require translation, the translator will extract data directly using a data extraction form, or review authors will extract data from the translation provided.Where possible a review author will check numerical data in the translation against the study report. Two review authors (AB and VYV) will independently assess risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2017 ).We will resolve any disagreements by discussion.We will assess the risk of bias according to the following domains. • Random sequence generation. • Allocation concealment. • Blinding of participants and personnel. • Blinding of outcome assessment. • Incomplete outcome data. • Selective outcome reporting. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. • Other bias. We will grade each potential source of bias as high, low or unclear and provide a quote from the study report together with a justification for our judgment in the \\'Risk of bias\\' table.We will summarise the risk of bias judgements across di erent studies for each of the domains listed.Where information on risk of bias relates to unpublished data or correspondence with a trialist, we will note this in the \\'Risk of bias\\' table .When considering treatment e ects, we will take into account the risk of bias for the studies that contributed to that outcome. We may allow a low risk of bias judgement for selective outcome reporting if outcomes described in the methods are fully reported and no expected outcomes appear to be missing, based on our knowledge of the field.We will not insist on a protocol or ClinicalTrials.gov in the absence of other reasons for concern. We plan to express results as mean di erences (MDs) with 95% CI for continuous outcomes (change in impairment, neuropathy symptom impairment, health-related quality of life).We will use a standardised mean di erence for results across studies with outcomes that are conceptually the same but measured in di erent ways.We will enter data present as a scale with a consistent direction of e ect.We will use risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcome measures (adverse events and participant-reported pain relief of 30% and 50% respectively). The unit of analysis will be the individual.Where multiple trial arms are reported in a single trial, we will include only the treatment arms relevant to the review topic.If two comparisons (e.g.drug A versus placebo and drug B versus placebo) are combined in the same meta-analysis, we will follow guidance in Chapter 23 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, to avoid double-counting (Higgins 2019) .Our preferred approach will be to halve a control group, if we have to combine the data in a single meta-analysis.If we identify cross-over trials, we will attempt to find the first period data and analyse the results as a parallel-arm trial. We will contact investigators or study sponsors in order to verify key study characteristics and obtain missing numerical outcome data where possible (e.g. when a study is available as an abstract only). We will use the I statistic to measure heterogeneity among the trials in each analysis.If we identify substantial unexplained heterogeneity we will report it and explore possible causes by prespecified subgroup analysis.We will use the rough guide to interpretation as outlined in Chapter 10 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, as follows. • 0% to 40%: might not be important • 30% to 60%: may represent moderate heterogeneity • 50% to 90%: may represent substantial heterogeneity • 75% to 100%: considerable heterogeneity We will avoid the use of absolute cut-o values, but interpret the I statistic in relation to the size and direction of e ects and strength of evidence for heterogeneity (e.g.P value from the Chi test, or CI for I statistic) (Deeks 2019) . If we are able to pool 10 or more trials, we will create and examine a funnel plot to explore possible small study biases.We will also consider selective outcome reporting as a form of reporting bias. When there is more than one trial with a specific treatment, we will calculate a treatment e ect across trials using RevMan 5. We will undertake meta-analysis only where this will be meaningful i.e. if the treatments, participants and the underlying clinical question are similar enough for pooling to make sense.When there are multiple studies using same drugs or di erent drugs with same mechanism of action, we will pool data for all the available primary and secondary outcomes. We will use a random-e ects model in RevMan 5, as this is usually a more conservative approach.Where analyses include both small and large studies, we will perform a sensitivity analysis to determine whether their results are systematically di erent, since use of a random-e ects meta-analysis will exacerbate the e ects of the bias in these circumstances.If they are systematically di erent, we will perform a fixed-e ect meta-analysis as sensitivity analysis. If the review includes comparisons that cannot be included in the same analysis (pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions), we will report the results for each comparison separately. We plan to carry out the following subgroup analyses when su icient data are available. • Disease duration (< 2 years versus > 2 years) • Dideoxynucleosides versus PIs • Duration of treatment (3 to 6 months versus > 6 months) The rationale for these analyses are as follows. Disease duration (less than versus more than 2 years): HIV-related DSP is likely to worsen with time like any other chronic neuropathy.Disease-modifying treatments for most conditions work better when started early in the course of disease.This is the basis for a proposed subgroup analysis based on duration.However, our choice of a 2-year cut-o was arbitrary. Dideoxynucleosides versus PIs: the former was associated with ATN in the earlier reports.While there has been decline in their use and availability of ART with better safety profile, the prevalence of HIVrelated DSP has not declined (in fact it has risen).Some reports also suggest that PI use may independently be associated with DSP. Duration of treatment (3 to 6 months versus more than 6 months): we have taken a minimum of 3 months as an inclusion criterion for duration of treatment as a shorter duration may test mainly symptomatic treatment.Even in the included studies, we will test whether longer duration of treatment (arbitrarily set as > 6 months) Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews di ers from shorter duration (3 to 6 months) in achieving a diseasemodifying e ect. We will use the following outcomes in subgroup analyses. We plan to carry out sensitivity analysis by conducting both fixede ect and random-e ects analyses. We will create \\'Summary of findings\\' table(s) using GRADEpro so ware (GRADEpro GDT), and present the following outcomes (e icacy outcomes and serious adverse events) following a minimum of three months of treatment.Three review authors (AB, VYV, and KT) will use the five GRADE considerations (study limitations, consistency of e ect, imprecision, indirectness, and publication bias) to independently assess the quality of a body of evidence (studies that contribute data for the prespecified outcomes).We will use methods and recommendations described in Chapter 14 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Schünemann 2019 ).We will resolve any disagreements by discussion or by involving another review author (DF).We will assess trial quality according to the GRADE criteria.We will consider RCTs as highquality evidence if the five factors above are not present to any serious degree.We will downgrade evidence once if a quality consideration is serious and twice if very serious.We will justify all decisions to downgrade or upgrade the quality of studies using footnotes and make comments to aid readers\\' understanding of the review where necessary.

To evaluate the e icacy, immunogenicity, and harms of di erent dose schedules and di erent types of HPV vaccines in females and males.

Amongst women with normal cytological findings, the worldwide prevalence of infection with any HPV genotype has been estimated in a meta-analysis to be 11.7%, with higher prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean, south-east Asia and eastern Europe (Bruni 2010).Amongst heterosexual men assessed at baseline in a multicentre trial in 18 countries in Africa, Asia-Pacific, Europe, Latin America and North America, penile infection with any HPV genotype was found in 18.7%, scrotal infection in 13.1%, perianal infection in 7.9% and infection at any site in 21.0%.Prevalence was highest in Africa and lowest in the Asia-Pacific region (Vardas 2011) .Prevalence of HPV infections in general is higher in men with HIV infection, men who have sex with men (MSM), and highest in MSM with HIV infection (Schim van der Loe 2014; Smith 2011). The main types of lesions associated with anogenital HPV infection are anogenital warts (condylomata acuminata) and intraepithelial neoplasia of the cervix (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, CIN), vulva, vagina, anal canal/perianal area, and penis.Intraepithelial neoplasia is a precursor of some of these cancers, although it can regress at earlier stages and does not progress to invasive cancer in most a ected people.A study that followed up women with inadequately treated CIN3 found that 31.3% (95% CI 22.7 to 42.3) developed invasive cancer a er 30 years (McCredie 2008) .HPV is also associated with squamous cell cancer of the head and neck (HNSCC).Of all head and neck cancers globally in 2012 (534,000), about 7% (37,000) were attributable to HPV, including 29,000 of 96,000 (31%) cases of oropharyngeal cancer (de Martel 2017).The incidence of cancers of the oropharynx has increased over time, more amongst men than women (Gillison 2015) .It is likely that HPV is a main contributor to the increase in men, whilst smoking dominates the rise in women (Gillison 2015) . The International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies HPV genotypes according to oncogenic potential, with HPV genotypes 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58 , and 59 considered as highrisk genotypes (Bouvard 2009) .HPV 16 and 18 are the most common genotypes in women worldwide and are associated with most cases of invasive cervical cancer; combined, HPV 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58 cause approximately 90% of all HPV-positive squamous cell carcinomas of the cervix (Alemany 2014; Bruni 2010; de Sanjose 2010).HPV 16 and 18 are also the cause of 90% of all anal cancers (Bosch 2002) .HPV 16 is found in around 80% of HPV-related anal squamous cell cancers, in 52% of invasive penile squamous cell carcinoma, and in 90% of penile intraepithelial neoplasia (Krustrup 2009 ; Schim van der Loe 2014).In a meta-analysis, HPV was detected in 22% of HNSCC, with 86.7% of those being attributed to HPV 16, although HPV 6 and 11 were also detected in a minority of cases (Syrjänen 2010) .HPV 6 and 11 account for up to 90% of anogenital warts (Greer 1995; Sturegard 2013) . Three prophylactic HPV vaccines, given by intramuscular injection, are available.All three vaccines are made by genetic technologies and are non-infectious because they do not contain viral DNA.They are made from purified L1 capsid proteins, which form viruslike particles that resemble the structure of specific genotypes of HPV.Each vaccine is directed against two or more high-risk HPV genotypes.All three vaccines contain L1 proteins of HPV genotypes 16 and 18 (WHO 2017) , because these cause about 70% of cervical cancer globally.The vaccines are commonly known by the number of di erent genotypes that they contain (i.e. the valency, Table 2 ). The bivalent vaccine contains L1 proteins of two HPV genotypes; 16 and 18.The quadrivalent vaccine contains L1 proteins of four HPV genotypes; 16 and 18, plus HPV 6 and 11, which cause genital warts.The nonavalent vaccine is the most recent vaccine and contains L1 proteins of nine HPV genotypes; 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58, plus HPV 6 and 11. All three vaccines contain adjuvants (Table 2 ).In addition to the licensed vaccines, as of September 2018, there are three vaccines in stage 2 to 3 development, two bivalent vaccines manufactured by Innovax and Walvax in China, and a quadrivalent vaccine manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (LaMontagne 2017). To prevent HPV infection, all HPV vaccines are intended to be administered, where possible, before the first exposure to HPV, that is, before onset of sexual activity.All national HPV vaccination programmes involve girls, and some countries have extended their programme to boys.According to most modelling studies, HPV vaccination programmes for preadolescent girls will be coste ective for the prevention of cervical cancer, particularly in settings in which infrastructure for cervical cancer screening is poor (WHO 2017) .HPV vaccination of females gives indirect protection to males.These so-called herd e ects mean that, at the population level, female-only vaccination programmes have resulted in reductions in HPV infections in both men and women (Drolet 2019).However, herd e ects from female-only vaccination do not a ect MSM, who experience a high burden of anal cancer and anogenital warts.Modelling studies also indicate that female-only HPV vaccination, even at high levels of coverage, will not prevent all HPV-related cancers in heterosexual men (Bogaards 2015) .The cost-e ectiveness of vaccinating boys depends on vaccination coverage in girls, the epidemiology of HPV-related disease, and the costs of the vaccine and the programme (WHO 2017). The uptake of HPV vaccination varies widely between countries that have introduced it as part of their national immunisation programmes.In 2017, across 82 countries coverage rates ranged from 8% to 98% (Brotherton 2018).To date, few countries in Africa and Asia have introduced HPV vaccine.Whilst there is evidence from some low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) that HPV vaccine can be e ectively introduced, countries with challenges have also been reported.For example, Uganda reported coverage of more than 80% for the first dose of a two-dose vaccine schedule, but this was not sustained for the second dose (Brotherton 2018). In high-income countries, such as England, Scotland, and Australia, school-based programmes have reached 70% to 80% of girls for Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews all doses.In other high-income countries, such as France, USA, Japan and Denmark, coverage has either not reached, or has fallen below 50%.The reasons for low coverage di er between countries, but include organisation of programme implementation, resistance from healthcare providers, adverse media coverage, and concerns about safety (Gallagher 2018). HPV vaccines containing virus-like particles of the L1 protein are prophylactic, meaning that they prevent infection and the development of intraepithelial lesions caused by HPV genotypes that are present in the vaccine (Stanley 2006) .The virus-like particles in the vaccines produce very high levels of antibodies in serum, but the exact mechanisms by which the vaccines prevent HPV infection are not completely understood.The levels of antibodies needed to provide protection against clinical disease caused by HPV (known as the immunological correlate of protection) have not been established because the number of breakthrough infections a er vaccination has been too low.The International Agency for Research on Cancer regards persistent HPV infection with HPV types 16 and 18, measured with standardised and validated tests, as an accurate surrogate marker for the precancerous lesions of the cervix and anus (IARC 2014) .Postlicensure data from national immunisation programmes show reductions in high-grade lesions of the cervix and anus with three-dose regimens of the bivalent and quadrivalent vaccines (Markowitz 2018 ).Since precancer is on the causal pathway to invasive cancer, it is assumed that prevention of precancerous lesions will also be shown to prevent cancer when su icient followup time has accrued in post-licensure studies.Less is known about the prognostic value of persistent HPV infection in the development of vaginal, vulval and oropharyngeal cancers (IARC 2014) . All of the randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that established the e icacy of HPV vaccines in the prevention of high-grade precancerous lesions of the cervix used a three-dose vaccination schedule (Arbyn 2018).Because of low HPV exposure and ethical constraints in conducting research that requires genital examination and specimen collection in adolescent populations (under 15 years of age), randomised e icacy trials of vaccines have typically been first conducted in women aged 15 to 25 or 26 years (Arbyn 2018).Once immunogenicity and harms have been evaluated, non-inferiority of immunological outcomes in 9to 15-year-olds is assessed in non-randomised bridging studies (e.g. Block 2006; Dobson 2013) .The International Agency for Research on Cancer regards bridging studies that demonstrate noninferiority as a su icient endpoint for individuals under 16 years of age (IARC 2014) . Vaccine schedules are designed to produce a strong and longlasting antibody response so that, when challenged by exposure to the real pathogen, the immune system prevents infection.A threedose vaccine schedule is typical for inactivated protein vaccines for infants; the second dose is given one or two months a er the first dose and a third dose six months a er the first dose.The first two vaccine doses are called \\'prime\\' doses that generate immune memory via B-lymphocytes produced in the bone marrow (Stanley 2014) .The second dose results in higher levels of antibodies than the first and increases the binding a inity of the antibody to the antigen, in a process that lasts several months.As a result of this process (a inity maturation), B cells with very high levels of a inity, di erentiate in the bone marrow into memory B cells that respond rapidly to produce antibodies on exposure to antigen and longlived plasma cells that continuously produce antibody at low levels. A third vaccine dose given at least four months a er the prime doses \\'boosts\\' these responses maximally to provide long-lasting protection (Stanley 2014) . Simplified HPV vaccination schedules with fewer doses should allow more people to receive the vaccine.Preadolescents and adolescents (age 9 to 15 years) produce stronger antibody responses to virus-like protein HPV vaccines than older adolescents and adults (Block 2006; Dobson 2013) , even a er a single dose (Sankaranarayanan 2016 ).It appears that multiple repeated doses of these vaccines are not required for a inity maturation and that long-lived plasma cells are more important than memory B cells in the immune response (Schiller 2018) .It is thought that structural characteristics of the virus-like particles allow e icient production of the long-lived plasma cells, which continuously produce antigen-specific antibodies, resulting in strong longlasting immune responses with reduced dose schedules (Schiller 2018) . Evidence of the likely e icacy of a two-dose schedule of viruslike particle HPV vaccines in preventing incident vaccine-type HPV infection comes from studies in which data from RCTs were analysed as cohort studies according to the number of doses of HPV vaccine received (Kreimer 2011; Sankaranarayanan 2016) .Kreimer and colleagues conducted a secondary analysis of data from an RCT of the bivalent vaccine amongst 18-to 25-year-old women in Costa Rica (Kreimer 2011) .In that trial, 20% of women did not receive all three doses of the vaccine.Women were grouped according to the number of HPV vaccine doses that they received.The proportions of women with incident HPV 16/18 infection that persisted for 12 months or more was similar amongst women who received one, two and three doses (Kreimer 2011 ).An updated analysis combined data from this Costa Rica vaccine trial and a pivotal trial of the bivalent vaccine, Paavonen 2007 , according to number of doses received a er four years of follow-up (Kreimer 2015) .In the modified total vaccinated cohort, vaccine e icacy against HPV 16/18 incident infection that persisted for 12 months or more was 83.7% (95% CI 35.7 to 97.5%) with two doses, and 92.6% (95% CI 89.2 to 95.1%) with three doses.Sankaranarayanan and colleagues analysed an RCT of the quadrivalent vaccine in 10-to 18-year-olds in India (which was stopped before enrolment was completed) according to the number of HPV vaccine doses received (Sankaranarayanan 2016) .Incidence of HPV 16/18 was 0.8% (95% CI 0.2 to 1.9%, 4/526) amongst participants who received two doses, and 0.4% (95% CI 0.0 to 1.3%, 2/536) amongst those who received three doses (Sankaranarayanan 2016) .Additional data from a systematic review of post-licensure studies in national HPV vaccination programmes, show the receipt of two doses of HPV vaccine was associated with a reduction in the incidence of vaccinetype HPV prevalence, anogenital warts and cervical abnormalities in some, but not all, studies (Markowitz 2018) . In practice, HPV vaccination rates in many countries remain low. Simpler HPV immunisation schedules have been identified as a potential strategy to increase the coverage of vaccination (Walling 2016) .The World Health Organization (WHO) recommended a two-dose HPV vaccine schedule in 2014, based on a systematic review of studies with immunogenicity as the end-point (D\\'Addario This review aims to extend the evidence base on the e icacy and harms of HPV vaccines by including and evaluating RCTs of di erent HPV vaccines and di erent dose schedules in adolescent and adult females and males, as well as women and men living with HIV infection. While RCTs can identify adverse events that take place during the study period, post-marketing surveillance is needed to continue monitoring harms associated with HPV vaccines in the population, and will be incorporated in future updates of this review. To evaluate the e icacy, immunogenicity, and harms of di erent dose schedules and di erent types of HPV vaccines in females and males. We included RCTs with no language restrictions.We included unpublished studies, studies in press, and abstracts without a fulltext publication, if they met the inclusion criteria. Females or males aged 9 to 26 years, including MSM.For the comparisons among people living with HIV, we included all age groups. Prophylactic administration of licensed bivalent (Cervarix, GlaxoSmithKline), quadrivalent (Gardasil, Merck), or nonavalent (Gardasil 9, Merck) HPV vaccines.We excluded studies if they assessed monovalent or plasmid vaccines, or assessed nonprophylactic uses of bivalent, quadrivalent or nonavalent vaccines. In addition, we considered for inclusion any trials reporting on the e icacy, immunogenicity, or adverse events in vaccines currently in phase 2 or 3 development.Studies comparing bivalent versus quadrivalent vaccines were excluded, as these will be included in an update of a separate Cochrane Review (Arbyn 2018). For males and people living with HIV, we included comparisons of HPV vaccines to placebo containing no adjuvant or only the adjuvant of the HPV vaccine, or another HPV vaccine. In this review, we use the term \\'control\\' to refer to comparator products that contain another vaccine or only vaccine adjuvants, regardless of the terminology used in individual study reports. We use the term \\'placebo\\' only to refer to comparator products containing no adjuvant or active vaccine.In Characteristics of included studies we have reported full details of the type of comparison group compound. The focus of the review was on di erent dose schedules and comparisons between di erent types of HPV vaccine.Where possible we stratified data by participant characteristics of age, gender, and HIV status.Specifically, we aimed to investigate the e icacy, immunogenicity, and harms of: • fewer than three doses of HPV vaccine in females and males; • di erent intervals between doses in a two-dose schedule in females and males; • HPV vaccination compared to control for males (a Cochrane Review for females has been published (Arbyn 2018)); • nonavalent HPV vaccine compared to the other HPV vaccines in females and males; • HPV vaccination in people living with HIV. Unless otherwise stated, primary outcomes were assessed at the longest follow-up time reported by the included studies. • Invasive cervical, vaginal, vulval, anal, or penile cancer • Adverse events related to the vaccines: local adverse events (overall local/injection site adverse events, redness, swelling, pain at the injection site), assessed at the follow-up times reported in the trials (usually up to seven days); overall systemic events and general symptoms assessed at the follow-up times reported in the trials (usually up to 15 days) • Serious adverse events and mortality: any events that are fatal, life-threatening, or result in hospitalisation and mortality.We collected information from each trial about whether these events were considered to be vaccine-related and the methods of adverse events data monitoring and collection, including mode of data collection, timing, attribution methods, intensity of ascertainment, harms-related monitoring and stopping rules, and reporting based on event frequency (i.e.frequency-based filter), based on the CONSORT statement extension for reporting harms (Ioannidis 2004; Lineberry 2016) . Unless otherwise stated, secondary outcomes were assessed at the longest follow-up time reported by the included studies. • Incident infection with vaccine HPV genotypes (HPV 16 and HPV 18 jointly; HPV 6, HPV 11, HPV 16 and HPV 18 jointly; and HPV 31, HPV 33, HPV 45, HPV 52 , and HPV 58 jointly) • Persistent infection (persisting for at least six months or at least 12 months) with vaccine HPV genotypes • Immunological outcomes (geometric mean titre (GMT) and seropositivity), assessed at one month following the last dose and at the longest-term follow-up For the comparisons of dose schedules (i.e.number of doses and longer or shorter interval(s) between doses) we considered immunological outcomes as primary outcomes because these trials were designed to show non-inferiority of immunogenicity.While these trials were not designed to evaluate e icacy or safety of the vaccines, we have included clinical outcomes when reported and comparative estimates of harms associated with the di erent dose schedules. We attempted to identify all relevant studies regardless of language or publication status (published, unpublished, in press and in progress) . All searches were conducted on 27 September 2018.We searched the following electronic databases: The search terms used are detailed in Appendix 1, Appendix 2, and Appendix 3. We also searched ClinicalTrials.govand the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) to identify ongoing trials using \\'genital warts\\', \\'condyloma\\', \\'anogenital warts\\', \\'venereal warts\\', \\'human papilloma virus vaccine\\', and \\'HPV vaccine\\' as search terms. We searched the reference lists of all included studies, as well as the reference lists of any relevant systematic reviews published within the search dates.We searched vaccine manufacturer web sites for relevant clinical trial reports (GlaxoSmithKline; Merck).In addition, we screened a list of HPV vaccine studies (Jørgensen 2018a), that was constructed through enquiries to HPV vaccine manufacturers and regulators, as well as searches of trial registers and journal publication databases.For each included study, where available, we identified and screened study governance documents (protocols, trial registration listings and results, manufacturers\\' clinical study reports) for relevant data and outcomes.We also contacted the vaccine manufacturers through the WHO Initiative for Vaccine Research for any additional, potentially relevant studies. Two experienced systematic reviewers independently screened citations and abstracts of studies identified from the electronic searches for potential inclusion.A third reviewer resolved any disagreements.We obtained full-text reports for all potentially eligible studies.Two independent reviewers determined the eligibility of studies for inclusion in the review from the full reports according to predefined criteria.A third reviewer resolved any disagreements. For the purpose of the review, we named studies on the basis of the first-named study author and year of publication.Many studies have more than one document associated with them: journal publications (main study reports, reports of long-term follow-up, secondary outcomes and post-hoc analyses), conference abstracts, and study governance documents (protocols, trial registration listings and results, manufacturers\\' clinical study reports).For each study we grouped these documents together and designated one report as the primary reference for the study; the study name is derived from the name of the first author and year of publication of this particular report. In cases where study reports emanate from the same parent study, but are planned or reported, or both, as distinct, discrete studies, we have named and handled these separately. Two reviewers carried out data extraction independently using pretested data extraction forms.We resolved any di erences by discussion between the two reviewers and referral to the study reports. We cross-checked data for the e icacy outcomes and adverse events between the primary trial publications, trial registries, and clinical study reports.We used the data derived from these sources with the longest follow-up time for the primary analysis. Two reviewers independently carried out \\'Risk of bias\\' assessments using the Cochrane \\'Risk of bias\\' tool for all included studies (Higgins 2011b) .We judged the risk of bias for each domain as \\'low risk\\', \\'unclear risk\\' or \\'high risk\\'.We resolved di erences by discussion between the two reviewers and if necessary we referred to a third reviewer for arbitration. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. We calculated risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes.We calculated rate ratios with 95% CIs for dichotomous clinical outcomes reported as incidence rates.For outcomes with rare events (i.e. an event rate of < 10%), serious adverse events, and deaths, we calculated Mantel-Haenszel odds ratios (OR) for dichotomous outcomes.We assessed the robustness of the primary analysis for very rare events with alternative statistical methods (see Sensitivity analysis). For continuous geometric mean titre (GMT) data, we calculated inverse variance (IV) ratios of GMTs with 95% CIs.Initially, we transformed the point estimates as well as the lower and upper bound of the 95% CI of GMT for each group into the logarithmic scale in order to obtain statistically correct standard deviations.Then we calculated the mean di erence of the compared group and back-transformed the results (point estimate and 95% CIs) to the original scale through exponentiation.Non-inferiority margins for immunological outcomes were derived from the individual trials (all trials used 0.5 for the GMT ratio).For GMT ratios non-inferiority is demonstrated if the lower 95% CI is greater than 0.5.If the lower confidence interval was below the non-inferiority margin, but the point estimate was within the margin, we considered the result to be inconclusive (Piaggio 2012). For adverse events and e icacy outcomes we carried out a complete-case analysis (the number analysed) and an intentionto-treat analysis when data were available.For immunogenicity outcomes assessed in non-inferiority trials, we favoured data from per-protocol analyses, in which all participants were HPV-seronegative at baseline.We did not pool studies with participants who were HPV-seropositive at baseline with studies with participants who were HPV-seronegative at baseline. If a single trial compared two or more vaccine arms (with or without a control arm), we labelled the arms separately in analyses.We grouped suitable multiple treatment arms (e.g.arms that evaluated di erent vaccine lots) and excluded irrelevant trial arms.We did not pool data from cluster RCTs with those from individually randomised studies. If data on specific outcomes or population groups were missing, we attempted to contact study authors or data owners to request this data.We did not impute missing outcome data.Where data were missing or losses to follow-up were substantial, we downgraded the certainty of study evidence due to risk of bias according to GRADE criteria (Guyatt 2011a). We described potential sources of clinical heterogeneity, and downgraded the certainty of the evidence according to GRADE criteria due to inconsistency where appropriate (Guyatt 2011b).When pooling of studies was feasible (i.e. at least two studies included), we inspected forest plots visually for potential outlying studies and variability in the estimated e ects across studies.We assessed statistical heterogeneity using the I 2 statistic.This statistic quantifies the percentage of inconsistency in the treatment e ects across studies beyond simple chance.We regarded heterogeneity as potentially unimportant if the I 2 was 0% to 40%; that values of 30% to 60% might represent moderate heterogeneity; values between 50% to 90% might represent substantial heterogeneity; and that values between 75% to 100% would represent considerable heterogeneity (Higgins 2011a) .Where considerable heterogeneity existed (>75%), we did not pool study data. We had planned to use funnel plots to investigate the possible presence of small-study e ects for each outcome.However, we did not produce funnel plots, due to the limited number of studies per outcome (i.e.fewer than 10) (Guyatt 2011c). When pooling was considered feasible, we employed a randome ects meta-analysis using the DerSimonian and Laird method (DerSimonian 1986), as it was assumed that e ect size might vary across studies and settings.We used data from the last available follow-up for clinical and adverse event outcomes, with the number of participants (rather than the number of events) used in the analysis.For immunological outcomes, we extracted data from one month a er the last HPV dose and at the longest-term follow-up. To assess the harms associated with the HPV vaccine comparisons in this review, we recorded the methods used in each included study to collect adverse event data, and extracted data on common events that we determined a priori as: pain, swelling, redness at the injection site and overall systemic adverse events.For all serious adverse events reported in the included studies, we extracted the number of participants, participants with events and a description of the events.We also extracted information on whether the serious adverse events were considered to be related to the vaccines.We did not conduct statistical hypothesis testing because our protocol did not prespecify hypotheses about di erences in the occurrence of any specific serious adverse event. We prepared \\'Summary of findings\\' tables for each comparison for which data were available for the following outcomes that were assessed as critical or important according to GRADE guidelines (Guyatt 2011d): • for females: high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, adenocarcinoma in situ, or cervical cancer; high-grade vulval and vaginal disease; • for males: invasive anal or penile cancer, external genital lesions; • for all populations: anogenital warts, overall local/injection site adverse events, overall systemic events and general symptoms, serious adverse events, deaths; • for comparisons of dose schedules (i.e.number of doses and longer or shorter interval between doses): immunological outcomes. We assessed the certainty of evidence in the review through discussion between review authors using the GRADE approach using GRADEpro online so ware (GRADEpro GDT).We assessed only the primary outcomes reported in the \\'Summary of findings\\' tables and appendices using GRADE.We considered the following factors for downgrading: limitations in the study design (risk of bias); inconsistency of results (heterogeneity); indirectness of evidence (applicability); imprecision (few events and wide Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews confidence intervals); and publication bias (Guyatt 2011a).When evidence was downgraded, we detailed the reasons in footnotes of the \\'Summary of findings\\' tables and summarised these in the Quality of the evidence section.Depending on whether evidence was downgraded or not, we rated the certainty of the evidence for each outcome as follows: • high-certainty evidence indicates that we are very confident that the true e ect lies close to that of the estimate of the e ect (evidence was not downgraded); • moderate-certainty evidence indicates that we are moderately confident in the e ect estimate: the true e ect is likely to be close to the estimate of the e ect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially di erent (evidence was downgraded one step for any of the factors described above); • low-certainty evidence indicates that our confidence in the e ect estimate is limited: the true e ect may be substantially di erent from the estimate of the e ect (evidence was downgraded two steps for any of the factors described above); • very low-certainty evidence indicates that we have very little confidence in the e ect estimate: the true e ect is likely to be substantially di erent from the estimate of e ect (evidence was downgraded three steps for any of the factors described above). We reported relative risks (ORs or RRs) in the E ects of interventions section for all relevant outcomes, but where the evidence was of very low-certainty we reported the number of events in each group only. We performed subgroup meta-analyses where possible, using vaccine type, gender, and age group (9 to 15 years; 16 to 26 years) as stratifying variables. We carried out one post-hoc sensitivity analysis for outcomes using a Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio where events were very rare (i.e. an event rate of < 1% across both trial arms).We compared the results of the primary analysis calculated with Mantel-Haenzsel methods against those with Peto methods (Bradburn 2007) .We also planned to conduct sensitivity analyses for the primary outcomes according to allocation concealment (high risk of bias, low risk of bias, and unclear risk of bias) for outcomes for which data could not be pooled because of considerable heterogeneity (I 2 > 75%). Overall, 20 RCTs were included for analysis in this review (Figure 1 ).The characteristics of individual studies and assessment of risk of bias are presented in the Characteristics of included studies section and Figure 2 . We found 20 RCTs that contained data on vaccine e icacy or harms, or both, and enrolled a total of 31,940 men, women, and children. Ten studies were multi-national and were carried out in two to 18 countries in Africa, Asia, Asia-Pacific, Europe, Latin America, North America, and South America.The other 10 studies were carried out in one country only (USA, including Puerto Rico (3 studies), Finland (2), Canada (1), Denmark (1), Japan (1), Spain (1), South Africa (1)). Owing to di erences in the protocols of the included trials, the maximum age for inclusion was either 25 or 26 years. Four RCTs evaluated the e ects of reduced dose schedules (Dobson 2013; Iversen 2016; Leung 2015; Romanowski 2011) .All these trials were designed as non-inferiority trials of antibody responses.They reported on immunogenicity as the primary outcome and on adverse events.None of these trials collected data on clinical events.These four RCTs evaluated the e ects of two doses of HPV vaccine versus three doses of HPV vaccine in adolescent girls (9 to 15 years).We did not identify any RCTs that evaluated the e icacy or harms of one dose of HPV vaccine. Four RCTs compared di erent intervals between doses.Two RCTs compared a longer interval two-dose schedule with a shorter schedule (0 and 6 months versus 0 and 2 months; or 0 and 12 months versus 0 and 6 months) of bivalent HPV vaccine in 9-to 14-year-old females (Puthanakit 2016; Romanowski 2011).One RCT of nonavalent HPV vaccine compared a two-dose schedule with a longer interval (0 and 12 months) and a shorter interval (0 and 6 months) in 9-to 14-year-old females and males (Iversen 2016).One RCT compared a longer interval three-dose schedule (administered at 0, 2 and 12 months) with a shorter schedule (administered at 0, 2 and 6 months) of quadrivalent HPV vaccine in 18-to 25-year-old males (Lin 2014). Two RCTs compared quadrivalent HPV vaccine versus control in 5189 males aged 16 to 26 years (Giuliano 2011; NCT01862874 2018) . A subgroup analysis of Giuliano 2011 also reported on the e icacy and harms of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine compared with control vaccine in MSM.Giuliano 2011 reported on clinical, adverse event, and immunogenicity outcomes, and NCT01862874 2018 reported on clinical outcomes and adverse events.One RCT compared bivalent HPV vaccine versus control hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine in 270 boys aged 10 to 18 years and reported on immunogenicity and harms (Petaja 2009).In addition, a cluster-RCT investigating both direct and indirect e ects of HPV vaccination of girls and boys (gender-neutral) and girls-only vaccination reported on adverse events in a subgroup of 3703 12-to 15-year-old males vaccinated with the bivalent vaccine or control HBV vaccine (Lehtinen 2018). We identified no studies investigating the clinical e icacy of the nonavalent vaccine in males. Three RCTs compared three doses of nonavalent vaccine with three doses of quadrivalent vaccine: one in 9-to 15-year-old females (Vesikari 2015), one in 16-to 26-year-old females (Joura 2015), and one in males aged 16 to 26 years (van Damme 2016).Joura 2015 reported clinical outcomes for the 16-to 26-year-old population. All three studies reported on adverse event and immunogenicity outcomes. We Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews participants a er vaccine administration, or field workers visiting or calling participants in their homes); both passive and proactive in nine studies; and in two studies, the details were insu icient for us to categorise as passive or proactive.Time frame (duration of follow-up) was reported for all but three studies; for two studies it was unclear, and one study did not report on adverse events (NCT00941889 2016).Methods to determine the relationship between vaccination and adverse events were reported by 10 studies: attribution was done by study investigators in nine studies and by a study co-ordinator in one study.Where the attribution method was not reported, we assumed this role was performed by study investigators.Fourteen studies (74%) provided definitions for the adverse events outcomes.Withdrawals due to adverse events were reported in 14 (70%) studies, but most studies (95%) did not report on how withdrawals would be handled in the analysis.Only one study reported harms-related monitoring and stopping rules (Hidalgo-Tenorio 2017) .Seventeen studies reported on all adverse events regardless of frequency (i.e. they did not use a frequencybased filter); NCT01862874 2018 used a 5% threshold for other adverse events; it was unclear whether Dobson 2013 used a filter, and one study did not report on adverse events (NCT00941889 2016). The length of follow-up for serious adverse events in the included studies ranged from seven months to five years.Table 1 lists the serious adverse events reported in each study.In all studies, the individual serious events were listed for each study arm.In five of the 20 RCTs, 50 or more serious adverse events were reported (Joura 2015 , Lehtinen 2018; Puthanakit 2016; Romanowski 2011; Wilkin 2018) .Information on whether serious adverse events were considered to be related to the vaccine is reported in the section E ects of interventions. We identified two studies that included both males and females randomised to HPV vaccine and control (Li 2012; Reisinger 2007) .The male population in these studies would qualify for inclusion in our review, but at the time of preparing this review we were not able to access data for males only.We have requested this information from the study investigators and, should these data become available, they will be included in a future update of this review. Li 2012 and Reisinger 2007 both compared quadrivalent HPV vaccine to vaccine adjuvant-containing control in 9-to 15-yearold males.The studies reported on the comparison of males with females for immunogenicity outcomes and adverse events for males and females as one group.Li 2012 was carried out in China, and Reisinger 2007 was carried out in 10 countries in North America, Latin America, Europe and Asia.See Characteristics of studies awaiting classification for further details. We identified 15 potentially relevant ongoing studies that have not been completed, but might be relevant for inclusion in future updates of this review.All studies are RCTs and studies may appear in more than one category of the list below: • eight include healthy females (NCT01735006; NCT02009800; NCT02405520; NCT02562508; NCT02733068; NCT02740777; NCT02834637; NCT03180034); • four include healthy males and females (NCT01824537; NCT02567955; NCT02710851; NCT02888418); • one includes HIV-positive MSM (NCT02087384); • one includes males and females cured of genital warts (NCT03296397); • one includes females with genital warts (NCT02750202); • seven are evaluating new vaccines in development in China (NCT01735006; NCT02405520; NCT02562508; NCT02710851; NCT02733068; NCT02740777; NCT02888418); • four are evaluating the quadrivalent vaccine (NCT02009800; NCT02087384; NCT02750202; NCT03296397); • one is evaluating the nonavalent vaccine (NCT01824537); and • three are comparing the bivalent to the nonavalent vaccine (NCT02567955; NCT02834637; NCT03180034). In addition to the seven studies ongoing in China, three of these studies are ongoing in Canada, and one study each in Costa Rica, France, the Netherlands, South Africa, and Tanzania.See Characteristics of ongoing studies for further details. We excluded 438 full texts.Twenty-two of these were potentially relevant studies, and the reasons for their exclusion are included in the Characteristics of excluded studies table.We excluded six studies because they were not RCTs, and two studies because they included females over 26 years of age.Most of the excluded studies contained no comparison of relevance to the review: seven studies compared HPV-vaccinated to HPV-unvaccinated females, five compared di erent intervals in three-dose schedules in females, one compared three-dose schedules of the bivalent and quadrivalent vaccine in young females, and one evaluated the e ect of a booster dose of HPV vaccine. The risk of bias for each included study is detailed in Characteristics of included studies and an overview is presented in Figure 2 . Overall risk of bias for each comparison is discussed in each results section below. We assessed most studies as being at low risk of selection bias, as they reported adequate randomisation sequence generation (15/20 = 75%) and allocation concealment procedures (15/20 = 75%). We assessed most included studies (18/20 = 90%) as having a low risk of attrition bias, as they reported withdrawals and provided adequate reasons for dropouts.We assessed one study as having a high risk of attrition bias because only a subgroup of included participants were analysed (Lehtinen 2018).We assessed another study as having a high risk of attrition bias because data for 62.5% (20/32) of the participants enrolled were missing due to early withdrawals from the study (NCT00941889 2016). For the majority of studies (16/20 = 80%) either a study protocol or clinical trial registry entry was available to determine that selective reporting was unlikely; we assessed these studies as having a low risk of reporting bias.We assessed four studies as having a high risk of selective reporting bias; Lehtinen 2018 because most outcomes were not reported separately for boys and girls, indeed, only adverse events were reported separately in boys, but in a selected subset; NCT00941889 2016 because predetermined outcomes, including serious adverse events, were not reported; NCT01031069 2017 because not all outcomes listed in the online trial record were reported in the trial result summary report; and NCT01862874 2018 because HPV disease was not reported as a separate outcome, but were reported as an outcome combined with persistent HPV infection. All included studies provided a statement of the funding source for the trial.Thirteen studies were funded by the vaccine manufacturers (GSK, Merck or Sanofi Pasteur) and we rated them as having an unclear risk of other bias.Industry sponsored studies are associated with favourable e icacy results and conclusions (Lundh 2017) which may be mediated by factors other than those assessed by the Cochrane \\'Risk of bias\\' tool.We also rated a further two studies as having an unclear risk of other bias because no published report was identified for either (NCT00941889 2016; NCT01031069 2017), and we extracted data from the clinical trials records, which provided insu icient information to establish whether there was a risk of other bias.We assessed the remaining five studies as being at low risk of other bias (Dobson 2013; To 2014; Hidalgo-Tenorio 2017; Levin 2010; Wilkin 2018) . See: Summary of findings for the main comparison Two doses of HPV vaccine compared with three doses of HPV vaccine in 9-to 15year-old females; Summary of findings 2 Two doses of HPV vaccine with longer interval compared with two doses of HPV vaccine with shorter interval in 9-to 14-year-old females and males; Summary of findings 3 Three doses HPV vaccine compared with control in 10-to 26-year-old males; Summary of findings 4 Nonavalent HPV vaccine compared with quadrivalent HPV vaccine in 9-to 26-yearold females and males 1.Two doses of HPV vaccine versus three doses of HPV vaccine in 9-to 15-year-old females or males The results for this comparison are presented in Summary of findings for the main comparison and Appendix 5. We analysed four studies in females that compared two doses (months 0 and 2, or 0 and 6, or 0 and 12) versus three doses (months 0, 1, and 6; or 0, 2, and 6) of HPV vaccine (Dobson 2013; Iversen 2016; Leung 2015; Romanowski 2011), and reported immunogenicity outcomes (seven months to five years) for all vaccine types and adverse event outcomes throughout the study period (one to five years). No studies included for this comparison collected data about clinical outcomes.No evidence was found from RCTs making this comparison in males. Immunogenicity results comparing two doses with three doses of HPV vaccine are reported in Appendix 5. Briefly, two doses were non-inferior to or had higher GMTs than three doses for all nine HPV genotypes measured except HPV 45 (where non-inferiority was inconclusive) one month a er the last dose (moderate-to highcertainty evidence).For seroconversion one month a er the last dose, there was evidence of little to no di erence between groups for all nine HPV genotypes measured (high-certainty evidence).At 60-month follow-up a er the first dose, non-inferiority of two doses of bivalent vaccine was inconclusive for GMTs of HPV 16 and HPV 18 (low-certainty evidence).Two doses of quadrivalent vaccine resulted in non-inferior GMTs for HPV 6, HPV 11 and HPV 16, while results were inconclusive for HPV 18 (low-certainty evidence).At 36-month follow-up a er the first dose, two doses of nonavalent vaccine resulted in non-inferior GMTs for all HPV genotypes measured except HPV 45 and HPV 52 where noninferiority was inconclusive (high-certainty evidence). Two studies found that two doses of HPV vaccine resulted in little to no di erence in pain at the injection site compared with three doses of HPV vaccine (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.03; 2 studies; 1189 participants; Analysis 1.1), but reduced swelling (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.89; 2 studies; 1189 participants; Analysis 1.2) and redness (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.96; 2 studies; 1189 participants; Analysis 1.3) at the injection site at up to seven days followup.The comparative evidence about serious adverse events was considered to be of very low-certainty (risk with two doses 36/1158, risk with three doses 35/1159; 4 studies; 2317 participants; Analysis 1.4).We downgraded certainty for imprecision and indirectness of the composite measure of all serious adverse events, which may or may not be clinically relevant, may or may not be related to the vaccine, and may occur outside a biologically plausible time frame relative to vaccine exposure.Two of the studies reported on withdrawals from the study and reported that no participants had withdrawn because of adverse events.One death was reported in the three-dose group (1/898) and no deaths (0/899) in the two-dose group (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.19; 3 studies; 1797 participants; low-certainty evidence; Analysis 1.5). Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews The results for this comparison are presented in Summary of findings 2 and Appendix 6.We included three studies in females that compared two doses with a longer interval between the first and second doses (months 0 and 6 or 12) with a shorter interval between the first and second doses (months 0 and 2 or 6) for immunogenicity outcomes at seven months for all vaccine types and adverse event outcomes throughout the study period (one to five years) (Iversen 2016; Puthanakit 2016; Romanowski 2011) .One of these studies compared a longer interval (months 0 and 12) with a shorter interval (months 0 and 6) in males (Iversen 2016) .No studies included for this comparison collected data about clinical outcomes.As each study compared di erent intervals, we did not pool the results in the meta-analysis. Immunogenicity results are reported in Appendix 6.At one month a er the final dose, there was evidence of higher (and non-inferior) GMTs for HPV 16 and HPV 18 with the longer interval schedules compared with the shorter intervals in 9-to 14-year-old females who received bivalent HPV vaccine (moderate-to high-certainty evidence).There was also evidence of higher GMTs for HPV 16 and HPV 18 at 36 months with the longer interval schedules compared with the shorter intervals in 9-to 14-year-old females who received bivalent HPV vaccine (high-certainty evidence).For seroconversion to HPV 16 and HPV 18, there was evidence of no di erence between groups one month a er the final dose (high-certainty evidence). For the nonavalent vaccine in girls and boys, there was evidence that a longer interval produced higher and non-inferior GMTs than a shorter interval for all HPV genotypes (high-certainty evidence). In The Iversen 2016 study reported on serious adverse events in males and females, but disaggregated data were not available by sex (Table 1 ).One of the reported serious adverse events (one case of systemic lupus erythematosus) in the 12-month interval group (Puthanakit 2016), was considered by the study investigators to be related to the vaccine and was the only withdrawal from the studies because of adverse events.No deaths were reported in any of the included trials (Analysis 2.5). The results for this comparison are presented in Appendix 7. We included one study that compared three doses of quadrivalent HPV vaccine with a longer interval between the second and third doses (doses administered at months 0, 2, and 12) against a shorter interval between the second and third doses (doses administered at months 0, 2, and 6) (Lin 2014).For the immunogenicity outcomes (Appendix 8), there was evidence of higher GMTs for HPV 11 with the longer interval schedule compared with the shorter schedule at one month (2 to 6 weeks test window allowed) a er the last dose. For GMTs for HPV 6, 16, and 18, there was evidence of little to no di erence between groups.The study did not collect data about clinical outcomes. This study reported local, general, and serious adverse events.No usable data were available for analysis of local and general adverse events so we summarised the results in Analysis 3.1.Briefly, among all study participants 172 local and general reactions were reported. The authors reported no significant di erence between groups (P = 0.26).No serious adverse events were reported (120 participants; Analysis 3.2). The results for this comparison are presented in Summary of findings 3. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Analysis 4.6), with confidence intervals that included the possibility of both fewer and more events with the quadrivalent vaccine (lowcertainty evidence for all outcomes). In the quadrivalent vaccine group, there were more overall local/ injection site adverse events than with the control (RR 1.12, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.18; 1 study; 3895 participants; high-certainty evidence; Analysis 4.7); the events included pain at injection site (RR 1. 4.12) .None of the reported serious adverse events was considered by the study investigators to be vaccine-related.Two participants from the quadrivalent group and seven participants from the control group discontinued participation in the studies because of adverse events.There were fewer deaths in the group that received quadrivalent vaccine (3 deaths in quadrivalent group; 11 deaths in control group), but confidence intervals for the di erence were compatible with no e ect (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.01; 2 studies; 5173 participants; low-certainty evidence; Analysis 4.13) at up to three years of follow-up (Giuliano 2011).Lehtinen 2018 reported on serious adverse events for a selected subset of males (data not shown).Fi y-eight of the 2436 subset participants (2.4%) who received the HPV vaccine and 25/1267 subset participants (2.0%) who received the control HBV vaccine experienced serious adverse events (very low-certainty evidence).The investigators reported that four serious adverse events among the males who received the HPV vaccine (abdominal pain, ulcerative colitis, type 1 diabetes mellitus, juvenile idiopathic arthritis) could possibly be vaccinerelated and one event among the males who received the control (type 1 diabetes mellitus) could possibly be vaccine-related.In the study on bivalent vaccine (Petaja 2009), three serious adverse events were reported in the bivalent vaccine group (3/181) and one in the control group (1/89) (Analysis 4.12; very low-certainty evidence).The study investigators did not consider these to be related to the vaccine, and no deaths were reported in either group. For the secondary outcome of persistent HPV infection, there was evidence that quadrivalent HPV vaccine reduced persistent infection caused by HPV 6, 11, 16 or 18 combined, or by each HPV genotype individually, in 16-to 26-year-old males compared with control (Appendix 9). The Giuliano 2011 study also reported immunogenicity outcomes (data not shown).Briefly, there was evidence that quadrivalent vaccine increased GMTs for HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18 when compared with control at 7, 24 and 36 months.There was a trend towards GMTs levelling o a er reaching a peak at month seven. Comparative data between quadrivalent vaccine and control were not available for the seropositivity outcomes (control group data not reported), but seropositivity for HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18 at seven months was above 97%.Petaja 2009 also reported immunogenicity outcomes seven months a er the first dose of bivalent vaccine were higher than the HBV vaccine (Appendix 10). The results of this comparison are presented in Summary of findings 4. We included three RCTs that compared nonavalent with quadrivalent HPV vaccine (three doses administered at months 0, 2, and 6): two in females (Joura 2015; Vesikari 2015), and one in males (van Damme 2016).The Joura 2015 study collected data on clinical outcomes in females at up to 4.5 years follow-up.All three trials reported adverse event outcomes throughout the study period and immunogenicity outcomes at seven months for all vaccine types.We did not identify any studies that collected data about clinical outcomes in males. In Levin 2010 included 7-to 12-year-old girls and boys with HIV. The study reported immunogenicity outcomes at seven months (Appendix 13).GMTs for HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18 were 123.8 to 935.8-fold higher at seven months, and 29.6 to 189.4-fold higher at 24 months, than in the control group (described as \\'identical placebo\\', the study did not specify the contents of the placebo) (lowcertainty evidence).Seroconversion for the four HPV genotypes was over 97% at seven months (low-certainty evidence).Injection site adverse events were more common with quadrivalent vaccine (21/96) than control (3/30) (1 study; 126 participants; very lowcertainty evidence; Analysis 6.4).Three systemic adverse events were reported, two in the quadrivalent group (2/96) and one in the control group (1/30) (1 study; 126 participants; very lowcertainty evidence; Analysis 6.5) at 14-day follow-up (three doses administered at months 0, 2, and 6).The study did not report on serious adverse events, but reported that 5/96 (5.2%) children in the quadrivalent vaccine group and 2/30 (6.7%) children in the control group experienced adverse events of grade 3 or 4 severity (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.14 to 4.18, analysis not shown). Hidalgo-Tenorio 2017 included HIV-positive MSM of 18 years of age and above, and compared quadrivalent HPV vaccine with control (saline placebo) (three doses administered at months 0, 2, and 6).This trial reported that 76% of the HPV vaccinated participants were seropositive for at least one of HPV 6, 11, 16, or 18 genotype at seven months compared with 30.2% in the control group (moderatecertainty evidence; Appendix 13).No serious adverse events (1 study; 129 participants; Analysis 6.6) or deaths (1 study; 129 participants; Analysis 6.7) were reported in either group at sevenmonth follow-up (Table 3 ). Two studies included HIV-positive males and females of 18 years of age and above and compared quadrivalent HPV vaccine with control (saline placebo in NCT00941889 2016 and \\'placebo vaccine\\' in Wilkin 2018 -the contents of the placebo were not specified). There was only very low-certainty evidence on high-grade anal intraepithelial neoplasia (46/288 in the quadrivalent group, 45/286 in the control group; 1 study; Analysis 6.1), recurrence of anogenital warts in participants treated for anogenital warts (1/7 in the quadrivalent group, 1/5 in the control group; 1 study; Analysis 6.2), or abnormal anal cytology (58/130 in the quadrivalent group, 72/132 in the control group; 1 study; Analysis 6.3).There was limited evidence for serious adverse events (quadrivalent 33/288 events; control 46/287 events; Analysis 6.6) or deaths (quadrivalent 3/288 deaths; control 6/287 deaths; Analysis 6.7) between the groups. The study investigators considered no serious adverse events to be related to vaccination, and no withdrawals from the studies due to adverse events were reported (Table 3 ). Denny 2013 included HIV-positive 18-to 25-year-old females and reported that, irrespective of baseline HPV serostatus, all participants who received the bivalent HPV vaccine were seropositive for both HPV 16 and HPV 18 a er the second vaccine dose (month two), and remained seropositive at month 12 (moderate-certainty evidence).Pain at injection site (RR 1.86, 95% CI 1.38 to 2.51; 1 study; 120 participants; Analysis 7.1) and swelling at injection site (RR 9.19, 95% CI 2.24 to 37.73; 1 study; 120 participants; Analysis 7.2) were more common in the bivalent group than in the control group (vaccine adjuvant only) at sevenday follow-up.The study reported 3/61 serious adverse events in the bivalent vaccine group and 2/59 events in the control group (OR 1.47, 95% CI 0.24 to 9.15; 1 study; 120 participants; low-certainty evidence; Analysis 7.3).No deaths were reported (Analysis 7.4). The study investigators considered no serious adverse events to be related to vaccination, and no withdrawals from the study due to adverse events were reported (Table 4 ). To 2014 included 92 HIV-positive females and males of 18 years of age and above, and compared bivalent with quadrivalent HPV vaccine (3 doses administered at months 0, 1.5, and 6).There was Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews evidence of no di erence, and inconclusive non-inferiority, in GMTs for HPV 16 between the bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccines at seven-and 12-month follow-up (moderate-to low-certainty evidence; Appendix 13).There was evidence that the quadrivalent vaccine was inferior to bivalent vaccine for GMTs for HPV 18 at seven months (ratio of GMTs 0.13, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.41; moderatecertainty evidence).Injection site reactions were more common in the bivalent group than in the quadrivalent group (RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.62; 1 study; 92 participants; low-certainty evidence; Analysis 8.1) at four-day follow-up.No serious adverse events at sixmonth follow-up were reported (Analysis 8.2; Table 5 ). One study reported on serious adverse events in 15-to 25-yearold females with HIV who were randomised to receive bivalent or quadrivalent HPV vaccine (NCT01031069 2017).Data for this study were only available through the clinical trials registry, so full details on the methods and other outcome measures were not available.There were nine serious adverse events in 167 female participants with HIV in the bivalent vaccine group and nine in 165 participants in the quadrivalent group (1 study; 332 participants; very low-certainty evidence; Analysis 8.2; Table 5 ).One participant in the quadrivalent group withdrew due to an adverse event.One serious adverse event (immune thrombocytopenic purpura) was considered by study investigators to be related to the bivalent HPV vaccine. We compared the results from the primary analysis with a sensitivity analysis using Peto odds ratios for outcomes with very low event rates (< 1%; Bradburn 2007).This did not change the size of e ect for most of the analyses, with the exception of some clinical outcomes in the comparison of nonavalent HPV vaccine versus quadrivalent HPV vaccine in 9-to 26-year-old females (Appendix 14). Changes were seen in the e ect sizes and 95% CIs for the following outcomes: • high-grade cervical disease related to HPV 31, 33, 45, 52, or 58 (Analysis 5.5)  This review reports on evidence about the e icacy, immunogenicity, and adverse events following reduced dose or alternative vaccine schedules in females and males, HPV vaccination compared to control for males, and e ects of HPV vaccines in people with HIV infection. Immunogenicity, e icacy and adverse events with fewer than three doses of HPV vaccine in females In adolescent girls (9 to 15 years) a two-dose schedule was noninferior to a three-dose schedule of any HPV vaccine.There was some evidence that GMTs decrease over time following both twodose and three-dose schedules, and that a two-dose schedule is non-inferior to a three-dose schedule a er five years.There was no di erence in seroconversion between two-dose and threedose schedules at all time points reported; almost all participants seroconverted in both intervention groups.We identified no studies that collected data about e icacy against clinical outcomes.There was very low-certainty evidence of little to no di erence in serious adverse events or deaths between dose schedules.No RCTs that evaluated the e icacy or harms of one dose of HPV vaccine were identified. In both females and males, for all HPV vaccines evaluated, a schedule with a longer interval between doses resulted in higher GMTs than a shorter interval.There was very low certainty evidence on the comparative risk of serious adverse events with di erent intervals between two-doses of HPV vaccine, owing to the very low number of events and indirectness.Results from single studies were consistent with lower or higher rates of serious adverse events with the di erent intervals tested in the studies. Three doses of quadrivalent HPV vaccine reduced the incidence of external genital lesions, anogenital warts, and persistent infection by HPV 6, 11, 16 or 18 compared with control among 16-to 26year-old males over a median follow-up of 2.9 years (moderatecertainty evidence).The quadrivalent vaccine resulted in more injection-site adverse events, such as pain or redness, than control (high-certainty evidence).There was very low certainty evidence on the comparative risk of serious adverse events and low certainty evidence on the comparative risk of deaths between quadrivalent vaccine and control among 10-to 26-year old males.Limited data were available regarding the e icacy and adverse events with bivalent HPV vaccine in males.We identified no RCTs that evaluated the e icacy of nonavalent vaccine compared with control in males. Among 16-to 26-year-old women, three doses of nonavalent vaccine or of quadrivalent vaccine resulted in a similar incidence of clinical outcomes regardless of HPV genotype at up to 4.5year follow-up (one RCT, high certainty evidence).The nonavalent vaccine resulted in reduced incidence of persistent HPV infections, CIN1, CIN 2/3, vulval or vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (grade 1) related to the HPV genotypes unique to the nonavalent vaccine (HPV 31, 33, 45, 52 , and 58) compared with the quadrivalent vaccine.Immunogenicity outcomes for nonavalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccines were similar for males and females.There was high- Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews certainty evidence that the nonavalent vaccine resulted in slightly more local or injection site events but little to no di erence in overall systemic events.The evidence comparing serious adverse events was of low-certainty.There was low-certainty evidence of no di erence in mortality between these vaccines.There were few vaccine-related serious adverse events reported (seven participants in total) in the included studies. In children living with HIV, the quadrivalent HPV vaccine results in higher GMTs than control at seven months, but there was only very low-certainty evidence about local or systemic adverse events. In adults living with HIV, the evidence about clinical outcomes and harms of quadrivalent HPV vaccine compared with control or other HPV vaccines, was of very low-certainty.One RCT in adults living with HIV reported that the bivalent vaccine had similar immunogenicity outcomes for HPV 16 to the quadrivalent vaccine, but resulted in higher GMTs and greater rate of seroconversion to HPV 18. This review collated evidence about the e icacy -in terms of clinical and immunological endpoints -and harms of di erent HPV vaccines and di erent dose schedules in females and males. The information sources searched include electronic databases, websites of the vaccine manufacturers, and a published index of HPV studies (Jørgensen 2018a), so the level of completeness is high. The applicability of the evidence to determine clinical e icacy and harms is, however, limited by the nature of HPV-related disease, as well as the design and outcomes of the studies.The evidence from RCTs about e icacy against severe HPV-related disease, including cancer, is limited for three main reasons.First, it is unethical to collect specimens from the cervix of girls who have not had sexual intercourse.Second, few severe clinical outcome events related to HPV infection occur during the study follow-up periods because they take a number of years to develop following HPV infection.Third, trial participants are o ered treatment when HPV-related precancer is found, so progression to cervical cancer would be expected to be very low, even without vaccination. The focus of this review was on clinical outcomes and harms.Immunogenicity is the primary outcome for many trials of alternative HPV vaccine schedules, however, as noted in the Background, randomised e icacy trials of HPV vaccines were first conducted in women aged 15 to 25 or 26 years (Arbyn 2018 2014) .Bridging studies have also demonstrated non-inferiority of immunogenicity outcomes of a two-dose schedule in boys aged 9-to 14-years compared to three doses in young women aged 15 to 26 years (Iversen 2016).Use of immunogenicity outcomes has limitations because the immunological correlate of protection and the duration of protection remain unknown (Donken 2015).These studies provide lower certainty of evidence, because estimates of clinical outcomes are imprecise and indirect. The nonavalent HPV vaccine was introduced more recently than the bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccines.This review included all studies that compared the nonavalent HPV vaccine with other HPV vaccines; two RCTs were identified in females (Joura 2015; Vesikari 2015), and one in males (van Damme 2016).A separate Cochrane Review of completed RCTs of three-dose schedules with bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccines in women aged 16 to 26 years shows protection against lesions of grade CIN3, but not invasive cervical cancer (Arbyn 2018).Further comparisons between the di erent HPV vaccines in women will be included in an update of the Arbyn 2018 review.Observational studies in countries that have licensed more than one HPV vaccine will also provide important information on the comparative e icacy and harms of the di erent HPV vaccines. With regard to serious adverse events, there is a large degree of uncertainty in the evidence comparing di erent HPV vaccines and di erent dose schedules.The \\'Summary of findings\\' tables show low numbers of serious adverse events and deaths in most included studies.Even when the total number of events is high (e.g.Joura 2015), specific events of clinical relevance are still too rare for meaningful comparative analyses.In this review, we used a composite outcome, that is, the overall frequency of serious adverse events, for each comparison, however, analyses based on a composite outcome can produce results that are di icult to interpret for several reasons.This outcome can include events that are not clinically relevant or are not biologically related to the vaccine (Lineberry 2016), occur outside a plausible time frame relative to vaccine exposure (Huang 2011) , or are not based on standardised definitions (Bonhoe er 2002).In addition, trials measure serious adverse events at di erent time points and there is a large variation in duration of follow-up, which could produce misleading summary estimates (Huang 2011) .Finally, there is heterogeneity among trials with regard to the age and gender of participants and clinical measurements of serious adverse events (Appendix 4).Meta-analyses of serious adverse events, such as those presented in this review, should be considered exploratory rather than confirmatory as the analyses are not planned in advance (i.e. when the included studies were designed) (Huang 2011) .Despite the uncertainty in the evidence about harms when comparing di erent HPV vaccines and dose schedules, a previous systematic review reported similar rates of serious adverse events when HPV vaccines were compared to control (Arbyn 2018). The risk of bias of the included studies in this review is generally low.We rated studies that received funding from the vaccine manufacturer as \\'unclear\\' for the \\'other risk of bias\\' domain.This judgement was based on the results of a systematic review which showed more favourable e icacy results and conclusions in studies sponsored by manufacturing companies (Lundh 2017) .It has been suggested that industry sponsorship of studies results in overly positive results through a variety of choices in the design and conduct of the trials that leads to bias.Based on the low risk of bias in other methodological domains and adequate reporting in the trials, we did not downgrade the certainty of the evidence using GRADE for this factor.In accordance with Higgins 2017, information on industry sponsorship and other funding sources is captured in the Characteristics of included studies tables. In studies where participants received a control injectionspecifically for the comparisons of HPV vaccines with control in Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews males and people living with HIV, and di erent interval schedules -many of the included studies used an adjuvant (either aluminium hydroxide or another aluminium compound) as the control rather than a \\'true\\' placebo (NCT00941889 2016 used a saline placebo; Levin 2010 and Wilkin 2018 did not specify the type of placebo).Aluminium adjuvants have been used in vaccines for many years as they are thought to enhance the immune response (HogenEsch 2018), but their suitability as control vaccines in RCTs has been questioned (Jørgensen 2018b).A previous systematic review found no evidence that aluminium adjuvants in diptheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccines cause any serious or long-lasting adverse events (Je erson 2004).The rate of serious adverse events was low for both vaccine and control groups in the studies included in the current review.However, the benefits and harms of aluminiumcontaining adjuvants are being further assessed in a Cochrane Review (Djurisic 2017), and research is underway to determine how suitable they are as control vaccines for RCTs. For a number of outcomes presented in the \\'Summary of findings\\' tables, especially serious adverse events and deaths, we downgraded the certainty of the evidence for imprecision.In most cases the sample size of the included RCTs was too small to be able to detect an e ect between groups for these outcomes -especially for rare outcomes such as death.This is another limitation of RCTs in determining the harms associated with HPV vaccines, and lends further weight to the future use of large observational studies.We also downgraded the evidence on serious adverse events for indirectness because of the limitations to the use of a composite outcome measure of events, as described in the section on applicability. We made great e orts to identify relevant published and unpublished data, through a sensitive electronic database search and screening of vaccine manufacturer websites.By linking clinical trial registry entries with published database searches, and by cross-checking the studies included and excluded from our review against a published index of HPV studies (Jørgensen 2018a), we attempted to minimise the risk of missed studies, though relevant data may remain unregistered or unpublished (Jørgensen 2018a). We used a priori categories of common adverse events -such as pain or swelling at the injection site -or important outcomes such as serious adverse events and deaths when extracting data from included studies.This method of data extraction could have been limited by the reporting in the included studies, as composite outcomes, such as \\'overall injection site/local adverse events\\', could not be calculated by reports of all events within the study populations.The range of di erent adverse events reported in the included studies, as well as the range of methods used to assess these in the studies, makes it unfeasible to extract all adverse events for the purpose of meta-analysis. We analysed and reported on all serious adverse events in the included studies.Serious adverse events are any events that result in hospitalisation and life-threatening illness.This means that any serious injury or illness is included, even if it is unlikely to be related to the vaccine.We also reported on results and attribution methods used to determine whether serious adverse events were related to the vaccine.We did not analyse these results or report them in the \\'Summary of findings\\' tables because attribution methods were either not transparent, or not independent of the study investigators (Appendix 4).These results are reported narratively in the E ects of interventions section. We restricted the sensitivity analysis of very rare events to alternative statistical methods available in Review Manager 5 so ware.We applied a sensitivity analysis to a number of outcomes where there were studies with zero events in both arms, but they did not contribute information when either method was used.It is possible that other methods could yield di erent results where there are zero events in both trial arms (Sharma 2017) . The results of this systematic review are in agreement with other published reviews on the e icacy of fewer than three doses of HPV vaccine (D\\'Addario 2017; Markowitz 2018).The current review aimed to provide further information on clinical outcomes and adverse events.This review provides evidence about other comparisons, such as vaccination of boys and comparisons across types of HPV vaccine, which have not previously been assessed. In general, the bivalent, quadrivalent and nonavalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines appear to be e icacious in eliciting immunogenic responses in both males and females for the targeted HPV genotypes and, typically, conversion to seropositivity is almost 100% amongst recipients.A two-dose HPV vaccination schedule is simpler to administer than a three-dose schedule.Immunogenicity data show non-inferior results for a two-dose when compared with a three-dose schedule of bivalent, quadrivalent and nonavalent HPV vaccine.The World Health Organization (WHO) strategic advisory group of experts on vaccination recommends a twodose schedule with at least six months between the first and second dose, irrespective of sex, if the first dose is given before 15 years of age (WHO 2017).In practice, 65 countries worldwide have adopted two-dose HPV vaccination schedules for girls, as of 31 December 2017.Amongst high-income countries that recommend HPV vaccination for boys, Australia, Switzerland and the USA recommend a two-dose schedule.Given the decision of the International Agency for Research on Cancer that immunogenicity is a surrogate endpoint for individuals under 16 years of age, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with clinical endpoints in this age group are unlikely. For males, including men who have sex with men (MSM), the quadrivalent HPV vaccine probably reduces the incidence of external genital lesions and anogenital warts (condylomata acuminata) compared with control.There were slightly more injection-site adverse events with the quadrivalent vaccine compared to control, but insu icient evidence to determine the e ects of HPV vaccine on serious adverse events or deaths when compared with control. The nonavalent vaccine and quadrivalent vaccines o er similar protection levels against cervical, vaginal, and vulval precancer lesions and cancer in young women and similar levels of immunogenicity for the four HPV genotypes included in both vaccines in females and males.For high-grade disease related to HPV 31, 33, 45, 52, or 58 (i.e.those genotypes covered by Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews the nonavalent vaccine and not the quadrivalent vaccine) in women, the e ect favours the nonavalent vaccine.No studies that compared nonavalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccines reported on clinical outcomes in males.The nonavalent vaccine was associated with an increase in local adverse events compared to the quadrivalent vaccine.Comparative evidence about serious adverse events was limited by imprecision and indirectness.Most of the evidence for this comparison comes from the 16 to 26 year-old age group in females, and there are far fewer data for younger females and males. Evidence about the e icacy and harms of HPV vaccines in people living with HIV is limited because very few trials measured clinical outcomes.In children living with HIV, quadrivalent HPV vaccine probably results in higher GMTs than control at seven months.In adults living with HIV the evidence about clinical outcomes and harms of quadrivalent HPV vaccine, compared with control or other HPV vaccines, was of very low-certainty.The duration of protection of HPV vaccines in people with HIV infection and the e ect of declining immunity on protection are unknown. We identified no studies for any new HPV vaccines in phase 2 or 3 development that plan to report on the comparisons of interest in this review. Further long-term post-licensure studies are needed to determine the duration of protection of one-dose and two-dose schedules, as well as the e icacy against HPV-related cancer endpoints in women, men, MSM, and people with HIV infection.RCTs of the e ects of virus-like particle HPV vaccines on cervical and anal cancer are likely to study surrogate endpoints such as immunogenicity and persistent HPV infection.For vulval and vaginal cancer, clinical disease is still recommended as an endpoint because of insu icient knowledge about persistent infection (IARC 2014) .The natural history of HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer is even less well understood.RCTs of the e ects of HPV vaccines will be needed, but might rely on persistent HPV infection as an outcome.The elucidation of the immune correlate of protection for HPV vaccines would be extremely valuable. Further RCTs to compare di erent vaccine schedules are needed to determine the most cost-e ective strategy to reduce the incidence of persistent HPV infection and related cancers.Evidence about the e ectiveness of a two-dose HPV vaccine schedule on clinical HPV-related disease still relies on non-randomised comparisons of RCTs (Kreimer 2015; Sankaranarayanan 2016) , and on data from national immunisation programmes (Markowitz 2018) .These studies provide essential ongoing data, but cannot fully overcome confounding e ects of di erences between groups that receive a certain number of doses.In immunisation programme data in particular, those receiving two doses as part of a three-dose schedule might only have received the first two doses with a one or two month gap and might be beyond the recommended age for vaccination.In this situation, these studies might actually underestimate the e ectiveness of a recommended two-dose schedule with at least six months between doses (Markowitz 2018 ). An RCT that commenced in August 2018 will provide information about the non-inferiority of one and two doses of bivalent and nonavalent HPV vaccines against incident HPV genotype 16/18 infections that persist for six months or more in young women (NCT03180034).In addition, long-term surveillance and registrybased studies, such as linking vaccination databases with diseaseand population-based registries, are needed to establish vaccine e ectiveness and harms over time. This review included a wide range of comparisons of alternative HPV vaccine schedules.In future, studies of the e icacy of di erent types of HPV vaccine, studies of alternative dose schedules, and studies of the e ectiveness of HPV vaccines in people living with HIV infection could be examined in separate systematic reviews.This review has highlighted the limitations of data about harms collected in RCTs, especially imprecision, owing to the low frequency of serious adverse events.Longer-term follow-up is needed to investigate links with specific adverse events, such as new chronic diseases or adverse pregnancy outcomes.Postmarketing surveillance allows continued monitoring and reports events following HPV vaccination in the population beyond the duration of follow-up in RCTs.Surveillance studies of large registrybased data from real-world vaccination programmes can also provide more precise estimates of the incidence of specific adverse events and investigate prespecified hypotheses.In these studies, attribution of whether serious adverse events and deaths are related to the vaccine can be performed independently of study investigators and potential conflicts of interest.Future updates of this review will include observational long-term post-licensure studies to allow more detailed investigation of specific harms associated with HPV vaccines, long-term data on the e ectiveness of HPV vaccines, and the value of di erent dose schedules in increasing vaccine coverage.Future reviews should also consider the synthesis of evidence from vaccination programmes in the context of gender-neutral HPV vaccination, where consideration of indirect e ects of HPV vaccination is needed to provide more relevant estimates of vaccine e ectiveness for public health stakeholders.

Study limitations deserve comment.As part of their standard protocol, the clinic preferentially transferred embryos derived from fully matured MII oocytes over embryos derived from MI-MII \\'\\'rescued\\'\\' oocytes.The investigators acknowledged that this practice introduced significant selection bias into the retrospective analysis of clinical pregnancy, miscarriage and live birth rates.Additionally, only 27 euploid blastocysts were transferred in total, with only 5 being day 5 transfers.Perhaps a larger sample size would have uncovered a statistically significant difference in the potential of these MI-MII embryos. The classical definition of in vitro maturation (IVM) refers to the maturation of immature cumulus-oocyte complexes from germinal vesicles to MII oocytes without exposure to human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) or luteinizing hormone in vivo (2) .The 4 major types of IVM in clinical practice (truncated IVF without folliclestimulating hormone [FSH], follicle priming with FSH, mild-stimulation IVF/truncated IVF, and rescue IVM) are characterized by differing exposure schedules to exogenous gonadotropin and/or hCG.Truncated IVF without FSH involves hCG administration/priming of intermediate follicles during natural cycles, such as in patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome (2) .Alternatively, follicle priming with FSH uses minimal FSH stimulation for approximately 3-6 days followed by retrieval with no hCG trigger (2).Mild-stimulation IVF/truncated IVF involves minimal FSH stimulation and early hCG administration to prime intermediate follicles (2) .These techniques have been used to minimize the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, or to minimize estrogen exposure in women with hormonally responsive cancers.Additionally, they have been used for fertility preservation in patients before gonadotoxic cancer treatment.Finally, rescue IVM, which is the technique used by Moon et al. (1) , is defined as controlled ovarian hyperstimulation followed by the in vitro maturation of immature oocytes at time of retrieval (2) .Rescue IVM does not require any changes in stimulation protocol and can be easily used in any standard IVF cycle. For an oocyte to undergo successful fertilization and embryo development, nuclear and cytoplasmic maturation must occur (3).Nuclear maturation is induced by the luteinizing hormone surge, initiating the resumption of meiosis, and can be confirmed by visualizing the extrusion of the first polar body.Unfortunately, a similar biomarker does not exist for cytoplasmic maturity.This desynchrony between nuclear and cytoplasmic maturity is likely a factor in the variability observed in fertilization and blastulation rates in rescued IVM oocytes (4) . In their 2004 study, Balakier et al. (5) argued that time may be a critical factor for human oocytes to undergo the essential cytoplasmic changes necessary for successful completion of maturation and preparation for fertilization.Similar to the study by Moon et al. (1) , they compared MII and rescued MI-MII sister oocytes and allowed between 1 and 6 hours for progression to MII stage.They performed ICSI on the MI-MII oocytes at time intervals of 1-1.5 hours, 2-2.5 hours, and 3-6 hours after polar body extrusion.They found that only 25% of oocytes injected 1-1.5 hours after reaching the MII stage fertilized normally; 43% after 2-2.5 hours, 59% after 3-3.5 hours, and 62% after 4-6 hours (5) .Oocytes in the Moon et al. (1) , study were reassessed 2-6 hours after retrieval and underwent ICSI at the time maturity was observed via polar body extrusion.If cytoplasmic maturity indeed lags behind nuclear maturity by several hours, perhaps the single time point of 6 hours after retrieval would be sufficient to optimize nuclear and cytoplasmic maturity of the oocytes, leading to potential increased fertilization and blastulation per oocyte after ICSI. Optimizing mature oocyte yield and maximizing euploid embryos for transfer remains a key area of research in our field.With the average age of the reproductive population continuing to rise, novel technologies that make IVF more efficient will become even more critical.Assisting the IVF clinician with improved yield from the laboratory is one such means to that end.We commend Moon et al. (1) , for their important contribution to the literature.\\n\\n==================================================\\n\\nFile: Beverage-intake-and-ovarian-reserve-among-women-fr.grobid.tei.json\\nTitle: Beverage intake and ovarian reserve among women from a fertility center\\nAuthors: Ana [\\'B\\'] Maldonado-Cárceles, Makiko [] Mitsunami, Andrea [] Florio, Paige [\\'L\\'] Williams, Jennifer [\\'B\\'] Ford, Irene [] Souter, Jorge [\\'E\\'] Chavarro, Lidia [] Mínguez-Alarcón\\nAbstract: Objective: To evaluate the associations of caffeinated, alcoholic, and sweetened beverage intakes with antral follicle count (AFC), a well-accepted biomarker of ovarian reserve.Design: Observational prospective cohort study.Setting: Fertility center at an academic hospital.Patients: This study includes 567 women seeking fertility care at the Massachusetts General Hospital who participated in the Environment and Reproductive Health Study.Intervention: None.Women self-reported consumption of caffeinated (coffee, tea, soda), alcoholic (wine, beer, liquor), sugarsweetened, and artificially sweetened beverages using a validated food-frequency questionnaire.Main Outcome Measure: Antral follicle count was assessed using a transvaginal ultrasound performed on the 3rd day of an unstimulated menstrual cycle or on the 3rd day of a progesterone withdrawal bleed.Results: Median (interquartile range) age and AFC were 35.0 (32.0-38.0)years and 13.0 (9.0-18.0),respectively.Median (range) intake of caffeinated, alcoholic, sugar-sweetened, and artificially sweetened beverages in servings/day were 1.08 (0-7.08),0.35 (0-3.84),0.04 (0-4.80), and 0.04 (0-7.50),respectively.All examined beverages were unrelated to AFC.The multivariable adjusted mean AFC (95% confidence interval) for women in the top and bottom quartiles of intake were 13.8 (13.0-14.7)and 13.8 (12.9-14.7)for caffeinated beverages; 13.8 (13.0-14.7)and 13.8 (13.0-14.6)for alcoholic beverages; 13.5 (12.6-14.4) and 13.3 (12.4-14.2) for sugar-sweetened beverages; and 13.2 (12.4-14.1)and 13.4 (12.6-14.3)for artificially sweetened beverages.Conclusion: Low-to-moderate intakes of caffeinated, alcoholic, sugar-sweetened, and artificially sweetened beverages were unrelated to ovarian reserve, as measured by AFC, in a cohort of women seeking fertility care.\\nBody Text: T he consumption of beverages is an important component of diet (1) , contributing to nearly 20% of the total energy intake among younger adults in the United States (2) .According to data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, between 20% and 50% of American adults consume any type of nonwater beverage, such as coffee, tea, sweetened beverages, or alcohol, on a given day (3) .The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans acknowledge the relevance of beverage choices to support a healthy diet pattern (1) .The caloric and nutrient content and the potential health effects that different beverage groups may have on health has been assessed extensively (4, 5) .Previous studies have linked the consumption of some beverages, such as coffee (6) , caffeine intake (7) , sweetened beverages (8) (9) (10) , and alcohol use (11) (12) (13) to mortality (6, 9, 12, 13) and cardiovascular disease (7, 8, 10, 11) and also potential effects of intakes of alcohol (14) (15) (16) (17) and caffeine (15, 16) , as well as sugared beverages (18, 19) on fertility. Among women of childbearing age, these beverages are consumed commonly in a given day, with women reporting a prevalence rate of approximately 66% for coffee/tea, 21% for alcoholic beverages, and 23% and 14% for soft drinks and diet beverages respectively (20) , and concerns have been rising about their negative effects on fertility (18, (21) (22) (23) .Caffeine and alcohol are 2 of the most studied dietary factors in relation to fertility (15, 16) , while intake of sugarsweetened or diet beverages has received less attention in relation to reproductive health (18, 19) .The effect that caffeinated, alcoholic, and sweetened beverages may have on fertility, however, remains controversial.Although the underlying mechanisms linking beverage intake to fertility are understudied, which makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions, (14-17, 19, 24) there is some evidence to suggest that coffee consumption and alcohol intake may influence the size of the underlying human oocyte pool (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) , determining the ovarian reserve. Possible biologic pathways have been suggested based on data from animal models.Ethanol consumption has been linked to follicular atresia, markedly in antral follicles (17, 31) , and increased susceptibility to oxidative stress in the rat ovary, which in turn may induce tissue damage, suggesting a deleterious effect of ethanol on ovarian structure (17, 32) .Caffeine and caffeinated beverage administration showed a toxic effect in decreasing the number of preantral and small antral follicles in rats, suggesting follicular atresia through deoxyribonucleic acid.Caffeine administration also resulted in an insufficient growth of preantral follicles, which may cause cell damage in the long term (33) .Consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages can promote insulin resistance by contributing to a high dietary glycemic load in humans (10) .Alternative beverages, such as artificially sweetened drinks, provide few to no calories, but recently it has been suggested that their consumption may lead to insulin resistance through stimulating a cephalic insulin response and alterations in gut microflora (10) .Insulin resistance could increase reactive oxygen species formation and decrease concentrations of glutathione, contributing to oxidative stress in the oocyte\\'s cytoplasm, which might lead to apoptosis in oocytes and increase the rates of antral follicle atresia in mice (34) . Therefore, as research on the relation between beverage intake and the human ovarian reserve is sparse and inconsistent (30, 35) , we investigated the associations between beverage intakes (caffeinated, alcoholic, sugar-sweetened, and artificially sweetened beverages) and antral follicle count (AFC), a well-accepted biomarker of ovarian reserve (36) , among women attending a fertility clinic.Specifically, we hypothesized that higher consumption of these beverages would be associated inversely with AFC. The Environment and Reproductive Health Study is a prospective cohort initiated in 2004 that enrolled couples seeking fertility care at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Fertility Center in Boston, Massachusetts (37) .Women aged 18-45 years were eligible to join the study.All participants completed demographic, lifestyle, general, and reproductive health questionnaires at study entry.A semiquantitative food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was introduced to the study in 2007 to assess habitual diet.In the current study, we included women recruited between 2007 and 2019 who completed an FFQ and had an AFC assessment as part of the diagnostic procedures.Of the 781 scans from women who completed the FFQ, we excluded scans of women using leuprolide acetate, women with a diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome, incomplete scans, repeated scans from the same women, women who completed the FFQ >1 year after their transvaginal ultrasound, as well as women who reported implausible total energy intake, leaving a final sample size of 567 women (Supplemental Fig. 1 , available online).The institutional review boards at MGH and Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health approved the study and written informed consent was obtained from all study participants. Diet was measured using a validated (38, 39) semiquantitative FFQ.In this questionnaire, women were asked how often on average they had consumed the foods specified during the past year.The questionnaire included 131 food and beverage items whose intake was reported using a 9-level scaleincremental frequencies of consumption for each item, ranging from <1 per month to R6 per day.Nutrient values for each food item were compiled from the US Department of Agriculture National Nutrient Database (40) and food manufacturers.Total caffeinated beverages intake was determined by the sum of coffee with caffeine, tea with caffeine, and caffeinated sodas (not sugar-free and sugar-free carbonated beverages with caffeine).Total alcoholic beverages were estimated by the sum of beer (regular and light beers), wine (red and white wine), and liquor.Sugar-sweetened beverages intake was calculated by summing intakes of sugarsweetened cola beverages (e.g., Coke, Pepsi, and other colas with sugar), other carbonated sugar-sweetened beverages (e.g., 7UP, root beer, ginger ale), and noncarbonated sugarsweetened beverages (punch, lemonade, sports drinks, or sugared ice tea).Artificially sweetened beverages were defined by the sum of low-calorie beverages with caffeine (e.g., Diet Coke, Diet Mountain Dew) and other low-calorie beverage without caffeine (e.g., Diet 7UP).To characterize overall food choices in the study population, we identified dietary patterns using principal components analysis, as previously described (41) , but excluding all beverages from the food groupings included in the analysis.We retained the first 2 factors from this analysis to allow for adjustment for overall dietary choices that may be associated with intake of specific types of beverages.The 2 factors identified represented a Mediterranean dietary pattern and a Prudent dietary pattern.Every subject was given a score for the 2 identified patterns according to their food consumption, and each participant appears in results for both dietary patterns.A high score corresponded to a high adherence to the dietary pattern and the opposite for a low score. All participants underwent a standard infertility workout as part of the routine clinical care, which included the ultrasonography determination of the AFC.Antral follicle count measurement was performed as part of routine diagnostic procedures by a reproductive endocrinology and infertility physician or fellow under the supervision of the treating physician, blinded to the diet assessment results, and following a standard protocol that was based strictly on the American Society for Reproductive Medicine Practice Committee recommendations (42) .Antral follicle count was ascertained by 2-dimensional transvaginal ultrasound in early follicular phase of an unstimulated cycle.Ovarian AFC was defined as the sum of antral follicles in both ovaries.All follicles >2 mm were counted.No fertility medications were used in the cycle before the ultrasonographic assessment.Of the 567 women included in the analysis, 22 (4%) had an AFC >30.To reduce the influence of these high values, we truncated AFC at 30.The median (95% range) of days between the FFQ and AFC examination was 34 (À383-247); with 382 (67%) women returning the FFQ after the AFC measurement. Differences in participant characteristics across quartiles of beverage intakes were assessed using Kruskal-Wallis tests for continuous variables and c 2 tests for categorical variables.We used multivariate generalized linear models with Poisson distribution and log-link function to estimate mean AFC and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) by categories of beverage intake.All exposure variables were categorized first into quartiles using the lowest category as the reference group.Specific beverages were categorized by tertiles or the median when the distribution was too narrow or a large percentage of women were unexposed.After analysis, results were backexponentiated to show them on the original count scale.For tests for linear trend across categories, the median value for each category was assigned and these values were used as a continuous variable.Nonlinearity was assessed with restricted cubic splines, which used the likelihood ratio test comparing the model with the linear term to the model with the linear and the cubic spline terms. Confounding was evaluated using substantive knowledge and descriptive statistics from our study population.Using this criteria, the final model included for age (continuous), body mass index (BMI; continuous), smoking status (never smoked, ever smoked), physical activity (continuous), education (high school or less, college degree or higher), total energy intake (continuous), the remaining beverages (continuous), dietary patterns (continuous), and race (White, other).Race was considered as a potential confounder based on previous research linking race and ethnicity to ovarian reserve as well as previous work linking alcohol intake to ovarian reserve among minority women (28, 43) .We did not make any assumptions as to whether these previously reported associations were a reflection of biologic or social factors.Interactions by age (<35, R35 years), BMI (<25 kg/m 2 , R25 kg/m 2 ), and smoking status were tested by including cross-product terms in the multivariate models because these parameters are all well-documented predictors of ovarian reserve (44) (45) (46) .Analyses were performed using the statistical software SAS v. 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC). The 567 women in our study were mostly white (83%; Asian 10%, Black/African American 4%), had never smoked (75%), and had college degree or higher (93%; Supplemental Table 1 , available online).At study entry, they also had a median (interquartile range [IQR]) age of 35.0 (32.0-38.0)years, and BMI of 23.2 (21.2-26.0)kg/m 2 .Median (IQR) AFC was 13.0 (9.0-18.0).Median (range) of beverage consumption (servings/day) was 1.08 (0-7.08) for caffeinated items, 0.35 (0-3.84) for alcoholic drinks, 0.04 (0-4.80), and 0.04 (0-7.50) for sugar and artificially sweetened drinks, respectively.Median (range) of caffeine and alcohol intake was 103.6 (0.31-955.5) mg/day and 4.7 (0-57.5)g/day, respectively.Participants in the highest quartile of caffeinated beverage consumption were slightly older, less physically active, and had greater alcohol intake and lower carbohydrate intake on average (Table 1 ).Women with higher consumption of alcoholic beverages also had greater caffeine and lower carbohydrate intake, were more often Caucasian, more physically active, and had ever smoked.Women consuming the lowest amounts of sugar-sweetened drinks on average were slightly older and had lower carbohydrate and total sugar intake, and higher fat intake.Women with the highest consumption of artificially sweetened beverages more often had lower education degrees, had a greater BMI, and caffeine and total sugar intake.Participants with higher intake of all 4 beverage groups also tended to have higher energy intake.A greater adherence by women to the Prudent dietary pattern was related to lower intake of sugar-sweetened beverages, whereas higher adherence to the Western diet pattern was related to greater alcoholic, sugar-sweetened, and artificially sweetened beverage consumption.No other subject characteristics were significantly different across quartiles of these beverage intakes. Intakes of caffeinated (Table 2 ), alcoholic (Table 3 ), sugarsweetened and artificially sweetened (Table 4 ) beverages were not associated with AFC in age and energy adjusted or multivariable adjusted models.The multivariable adjusted mean AFC (95% CI) for women in the top and bottom quartiles of intake for specific beverages were 13.8 (13.0-14.7)and 13.8 (12.9-14.7)for caffeinated beverages (Table 2 ); 13.8 (13.0-14.7)and 13.8 (13.0-14.6)for alcoholic beverages (Table 3 ); 13.5 (12.6-14.4) and 13.3 (12.4-14.2) for sugar-sweetened beverages (Table 4 ); and 13.2 (12.4-14.1)and 13.4 (12.6-14.3)for artificially sweetened beverages (Table 4 ).When intake of specific beverages was assessed, we also found no relationships between caffeinated, decaffeinated items, alcoholic, and sweetened beverages in adjusted models.Similar associations were found after stratification by age (<35 vs. R35 years), BMI (<25 vs. R25 kg/m 2 ), and smoking status (never vs. ever smoker; Supplemental Tables 2-5, available online).We also tested for departures from linearity by fitting a spline model for each beverage intake (Supplemental Figs. 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 ).There was no evidence of departure from linearity for the relationships between each beverage intake and AFC except for coffee consumption (P nonlinearity ¼ .02).However, after restriction at the 97.5th percentile of the coffee intake distribution, this statistically significant association was no longer observed (P nonlinearity ¼ .58).Last, because 32 (5.6%) of 567 women had an FFQ >1 year before the ultrasound measurement, we conducted a sensitivity analysis among the sample of 535 women (Supplemental Tables 6 7 8 , available online).Similar to our main results, we found no statistically significant associations between beverage intake and AFC in the adjusted models (PR.05). Among women seeking fertility care in Boston, we found that low-to-moderate intakes of caffeinated, alcoholic, sugarsweetened, and artificially sweetened beverages were not related to ovarian reserve measured as AFC.These results suggest that a usual consumption of these beverages within the observed ranges of intake among a cohort of women seeking fertility care may not adversely impact the ovarian reserve.Similar to our results, 4 previous studies (30, (47) (48) (49) have found no associations of caffeine and caffeinated beverage intake with ovarian reserve biomarkers such as AFC or circulating antim€ ullerian hormone (AMH) concentrations.Women included in these 4 studies had an average age similar to women in our study (34-37 years (30, 47-49) from a fertility clinic (30) or had a pregnancy, the majority ending in loss (47, 48) .In contrast, a cross-sectional study exploring the effects of environmental factors on ovarian toxicity in South Africa reported lower AMH concentrations among 420 women who drank coffee regularly for at least once per week for R6 months (27) .This study included eumenorrheic younger women (20-30 years, median 24 years) with no previous problems becoming pregnant.Since epidemiologic studies investigating the associations of caffeinated beverage consumption on ovarian reserve are scarce, more studies on the topic are warranted to reevaluate the associations, especially among women with different amounts of intakes as well as women from the general population. The relationship between alcohol, alcoholic beverages, and markers of ovarian reserve has been examined in several studies, however, yielding conflicting results.Most of these studies reported either no (28, 29, 47, 48, (50) (51) (52) (53) or inverse (26, 30) associations with AFC, or circulating concentrations of AMH (27, 28, 30) .The Study of Environment, Lifestyle and Fibroids also examined the impact of specific patterns of alcohol intake (28) .Among current alcohol drinkers, binge drinking (R2 days/week) vs. drinkers who never binged showed 26% lower AMH levels, a marker of ovarian reserve.However, past binge drinking a Adjusted for age, body mass index, smoking status, race, physical activity, education, total energy intake, the remaining beverages and the dietary patterns without the specific beverages.Sugarsweetened beverages include sugar-sweetened cola beverages (e.g., Coke, Pepsi, and other colas with sugar), other carbonated sugar-sweetened beverages (e.g., 7-Up, root beer, ginger ale), and noncarbonated sugar-sweetened beverages (punch, lemonade, sports drinks, or sugared ice tea).Artificially sweetened beverages include low-calorie beverages with caffeine (e.g., Diet Coke, Diet Mt.Dew) and other low-calorie beverage without caffeine (e.g., Diet 7-Up).b P< .05 for comparison of specific category vs. category 1 (reference).

To our knowledge, only 1 previous work examined the association between sweetened beverages, specifically soft drinks, and ovarian reserve markers (49) .This recent study of healthy premenopausal women aimed to investigate different food and beverage intake groups and ovarian reserve.In line with our results, the investigators did not find any association between soft drink consumptions and decline in AMH concentrations.However, this work did not distinguish between sugar-sweetened and artificially sweetened beverage intake.Thus, our study represents a more comprehensive assessment of soft drinks according to its energy content in relation to ovarian reserve, and specifically examining the link between sweetened beverages and a marker of ovarian reserve in a cohort of women presenting to a fertility center.Possible explanations for the discrepant results across studies include the study population characteristics, differential study sizes, timing of beverage assessment, different patterns and levels of consumption, heterogeneity in covariate adjustment, and failure to distinguish specific beverage groups, which may contain other components than caffeine or alcohol that could contribute to health effects. Our findings should be interpreted in light of the strengths and limitations of the study.Diet was assessed using a self-reported FFQ, thus measurement error is possible.However, this instrument has been validated previously (38, 39) and subjects who reported implausible amounts of energy intake (n ¼ 13) were excluded from the analysis (54) .Moreover, because the distribution of beverage intake was skewed toward high values, which are more likely to be affected by errors in data collection or processing, we modeled beverage intake using rank-based groups to obtain conservative estimates that are less susceptible to be influenced by individuals with high intakes.Although caffeine content from medications was not measured in our study, caffeinated beverages represent the major source of caffeine intake from diet (98% among US population) (55) and consumption of caffeine containing medications would not be considered representative of a long-term dietary caffeine intake as they typically are indicated for short-term use (relief of symptoms and stimulant indications) (56) .Most women reported low-tomoderate beverage intake levels, thereby we cannot rule out possible associations among women with high consumption.Another important consideration when investigating the relation of diet with health outcomes is the extent to which dietary behaviors, including intake of specific beverages, are influenced or constrained by contextual factors, such as food security or neighborhood-level food access.Although it has been well documented that socioeconomic status is related to contextual factors that constrain food choices (57) , the socioeconomic characteristics of participants in our study suggest that this one is not a study population with a high proportion of individuals vulnerable to major constraints in their food choices.An additional concern is that, as AFC assessment is part of the routine diagnostic evaluation of all fertility patients at MGH, multiple physicians were involved in AFC assessment over the course of the study.Nevertheless, all physicians were trained to perform the ultrasound evaluation according to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine recommendations (42) and previous works suggest AFC is a highly reproducible measure with minimal interobserver variability (42, 58) .Moreover, all physicians who performed the scans were blinded to the diet assessments, minimizing the risk of biased AFC assessments related to the level of exposure.Due to the observational design, residual confounding from unobserved or unmeasured confounders cannot be excluded.However, we adjusted for several potential confounders including dietary patterns and important reproductive and demographic characteristics.Diet was assessed among a cohort of women with a median (IQR) age of 35 (32.0-38.0)years, which may represent a sensitive time frame for the ovarian reserve because an important decline in quality as well as quantity occurs after 30 years of age and plummets after 35 years (59) .However, due to our study design, we were not able to examine a longer diet exposure window.Time frame of exposure and of end points assessment might represent a crucial point, given the differential susceptibility of the ovary and the diverse developmental stages.This is of special relevance for prenatal exposures occurring within an exceptionally sensitive time frame, coinciding with ovarian development and primordial follicle pool formation, which might represent a strong limitation of studies (17) .In relation to alcohol, a longitudinal work examining the effect of in utero exposure to parental alcohol intake failed to find associations with AMH levels of daughters at adolescence (17, 60) .These results could suggest a negligible or lack of effect on the ovarian development and primordial follicle pool formation (17) .Our diet assessment would capture the relevant time period of folliculogenesis of these women, which requires approximately 1 year for a primordial follicle to grow and develop before ovulation (61) .Thus, it may identify effects on the size of the growing pool, and consequently, the ovarian reserve.The number of growing oocytes is correlated with the primordial pool; therefore, the effects detected in the growing cohort, if any, also may reflect changes in the latter group.We did not include circulating AMH concentrations (another well-accepted ovarian reserve biomarker) as an outcome because of the small sample size, mainly because the measurements were performed routinely starting 2013, and the assay was changed at a certain point, making it difficult to combine measures over time.Nevertheless, AMH and AFC are considered the most sensitive and specific measures of ovarian reserve and have been shown to be equivalent in multiple studies (42) . Currently, a universally accepted clinical cutoff to distinguish between normal and abnormal results for AFC has not been established (43) , limiting our capacity to assess beverage intake in relation to risk of low ovarian reserve with the use of a threshold value comparable across studies.Finally, this work included participants from a fertility clinic, mostly white (83.0% vs. 60.1% in the US Census [62] ), lean and with high educational degrees, which strengthens the internal validity of the study but may limit the generalizability of our findings to women from racial/ethnic minority backgrounds where ethnic or cultural differences in food choice may not be represented, and to women in the general population. In conclusion, our results show no association between lowto-moderate intake of alcoholic, caffeinated, sugarsweetened, and artificially sweetened beverages with AFC, a well-accepted marker of ovarian reserve.Similarly, specific beverages as coffee, tea, soda, beer, wine, or liquor were unrelated to AFC.Our findings also suggest that previously reported associations between intake of these beverages with fertility is unlikely to be due to impaired ovarian reserve.Considering the wide consumption of beverages in diet, future research on this topic should revisit this among women in the general population as well as among women who consumed different amounts of these beverages to better characterize the association of beverage intake on the ovarian reserve.

As with most health disparities work in its infancy, the focus on disparities in infertility has been on access and outcomes thus far.Multiple analyses of data collected from the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology Clinic Outcomes Reporting System suggest that Black women experience lower success rates after fertility treatments, compared with non-Hispanic White women.Population-based analyses like these, as well as those from clinical practices, only include the subset of Black women who were able to attain access to assisted reproductive technology-excluding the large population of women who were never diagnosed, evaluated, or treated. The most often-cited explanation for the profound gap in access to fertility care is the high costs and financial stress associated with fertility treatment.Most patients who undergo in vitro fertilization (IVF) in the United States lack insurance coverage for fertility treatment.When coverage is available, certain types of fertility services (e.g., testing) are more likely to be covered than others (e.g., IVF).As a result, many individuals pay out of their pockets for their medical treatment, which can be substantial, given that the median price of an IVF cycle in the United States is reported to be $19,200 (1) . To date, this economic barrier has been the primary target of efforts to address disparities in access.Many believe that providing financial support in the form of state-mandated insurance coverage for infertility treatment would be the \\'\\'solution\\'\\'-resulting in the demographics of women receiving care being more representative of the general population.Unfortunately, multiple studies have found that racial disparities persist in enhanced or equal access to care models (e.g., in Massachusetts, a state with mandated and comprehensive insurance coverage of fertility treatment) suggesting that access alone is not the problem.Despite state law-mandated insurance coverage for fertility care in 19 states, fertility services continue to be primarily accessed by highly educated, wealthy, White women.The initiatives to reduce economic barriers are necessary but insufficient to address the inequity in access to fertility care.Even in the United Kingdom, where fertility services are publicly funded, women from minority populations face significant challenges when seeking fertility care.Clearly, a better understanding of the \\'\\'noneconomic\\'\\' barriers impacting a woman\\'s decision to seek treatment will need to be the focus of future attempts to ameliorate the prevailing disparities.Although there is some literature examining cultural and societal factors that impede access to fertility care in the United States, these studies have overwhelmingly considered the experiences of White women.If we want to make progress toward equity, we must center our efforts on the living reality of those who experience the greatest inequities. Black women have the lowest rates of utilization of fertility treatment and wait approximately 20 months longer than White women to access care.Qualitative studies have offered some insight into the individual factors contributing to this delay (e.g., psychobiological and sociocultural barriers) (2), but the institutional and structural factors that affect access to fertility services are largely unexplored.Black women are not deciding whether to seek fertility care in a vacuum; in addition to current social conditions, the historical context of systemic racism continues to shape their decision-making and reproductive health. The pervasive stereotype that Black women are hyperfertile, which was used to justify many atrocities, continues to cause harm today.Consciously or unconsciously, these falsehoods affect how Black women view themselves and how others view them.Internalized stigma may delay a woman\\'s decision to seek fertility care, while implicit and explicit physician bias can also lead to medical gatekeeping (3).Prejudice regarding who can suffer from infertility and who deserves to be a parent influences how Black women are counseled about their fertility, perpetuating disparities in patient knowledge, awareness, and access to care. To meaningfully narrow the existing gaps, concerted efforts are needed to systematically examine the multifaceted causes of these inequities.Rather than starting with the disparity (utilization of fertility care) and \\'\\'working backward\\'\\' to investigate the differential disease characteristics and interactions with the health system that immediately precede the differential outcome, we also need to take a \\'\\'topdown\\'\\' approach.Along with an individual\\'s identity, the greater social, political, and structural context determines the exposures they experience throughout their life.These exposures, in turn, influence the differential disease characteristics and interactions with the health system (4). Health equity frameworks highlight the need for interventions that move beyond the individual level.The reproductive justice framework, for example, uses intersectionality theory to consider the societal, institutional, and systemic contexts within which individuals make reproductive decisions (5) .Created by Black women as a more inclusive model for all women nearly 3 decades ago, reproductive justice rests on 4 core tenets: every person is endowed with the human right to bodily autonomy; have children; not have children; and parent their children in safe, sustainable communities.The framework was born out of debates on the right to access contraception and abortion care, specifically the shortcomings of the \\'\\'choice\\'\\' movement.Recently, with the increasing awareness of racial disparities in maternal morbidity and mortality, there has been more focus on the tenets of bodily autonomy and the right to parent; however, the right to have a child (specifically, access to fertility care) has not garnered much attention. Although now is an especially critical time to advocate for access to safe abortion and obstetric care, it is also incumbent on us to prioritize our efforts to achieve equity in fertility care.To do so, multipronged efforts to understand and improve the social, political, and structural context in which our patients live and make decisions will be necessary.In other words, we need to start at the roots of the inequity, and we need to start now. During National Infertility Awareness Week, we aim to empower the public through increased understanding and awareness; this \\'\\'education\\'\\' should be bidirectional.We must assign greater value to the patient\\'s experience and the patient\\'s voice, with particular attention to feedback from the communities that are underserved by our field.This also means funding and prioritizing research that, rather than simply identifying disparities, works to understand their causes.Additionally, we need to develop interventions to address these causes and allow us to move toward equity. By doing this, we move beyond being part of the problem and move toward being partners in creating a solution.

In this open format, we reflect on the old parable, Six Blind Men and An Elephant, which has its origins in the Rigveda, an ancient Indian collection of hymns from 1500 to 1000 BCE (1) .In a later Buddhist translation, Buddha\\'s disciples asked for guidance regarding \\'\\'those who indulged in constant dispute.\\'\\'Buddha answered, \\'\\'Once upon a time there was a Raja (king) who asked his followers to show an elephant to six men who were born blind.\\'\\'To one, he presented the trunk of the elephant, to another its tusk, ears, side, leg, and tail, saying to each one that was the elephant.When finally each man was asked to describe the elephant, each adamantly replied, with the first blind man arguing that: \\'\\'An elephant is like a giant snake\\'\\'; the second, after feeling the elephant\\'s pointed tusk said: \\'\\'You are wrong, this creature is as sharp and deadly as a spear.\\'\\'; the third, touching one of the elephant\\'s ears said: \\'\\'What we have here is a fan.\\'\\';The fourth, touching one of the elephant\\'s legs said: \\'\\'What we have here is an animal like a tree.\\'\\'The fifth, feeling the elephant\\'s side said: \\'\\'I believe an elephant is like a wall.\\'\\'Although the sixth blind men scoffed after tugging on the elephant\\'s coarse tail: \\'\\'Why, this is nothing more than a piece of old rope.\\'\\'The Raja asked the blind men, \\'\\'How can each of you be so certain you are right?\\'\\'As the 6 blind men considered, but remained silent, the Raja replied, \\'\\'Since each man touched only one part, if you put the parts together, you will see the truth,\\'\\' and the blind men agreed and said: \\'\\'To learn the truth (facts), we must put all the parts together. \\'\\' In the last 20 years, the landscape of reproductive endocrine infertility (REI) has undergone an enormous transition.Assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) have become the mainstay of many practices, and there are those within the specialty that question the role of reproductive surgery given the success rates of ART (2) .Conversely, there are many others in the field who argue that reproductive surgery continues to be innovative and remains an important component of treating the infertile couple and women of childbearing age, especially those with fibroids, symptomatic endometriosis, hydrosalpinges, ovarian cysts, intrauterine adhesions, and m€ ullerian anomalies (3). Furthermore, REI surgeons have been the pioneers of microsurgery and minimally invasive surgery, founding the Society of Reproductive Surgeons in 1984, and serving as a forum for those members of the American Society of Reproductive Medicine with special interest and competency in reproductive surgery.However, as the specialty has progressed, which gynecologic subspecialty is best suited to manage women with reproductive pathology requiring fertility-preserving surgery has been raised.This shift can be attributed to a variety of factors, including the advancement in ART and robot-assisted surgery, a dearth of dedicated REI surgeons, and a continued need to manage reproductive pathologies.Over the last 15-20 years, along with the development of a gynecologic fellowship and certification in minimally invasive surgery, there has been an increase in minimally invasive gynecologic surgeons (MIGS) and gynecologic oncologists (GOs) performing \\'\\'fertility-sparing surgery,\\'\\' which was historically performed only by the REI surgeons.Additionally, in the setting of complex or advanced pathology, many benign reproductive pathologies may be referred to the gynecologic oncologist for management. We find the REI-MIGS-GO approach toward \\'\\'fertilitysparing surgery\\'\\' like the blind men and elephant parable.Each is a distinct discipline looking at the same subject.Similar to touching different parts of the elephant, MIGS, GO, and REI have experience, and perspectives that are unique and different. Although there are clear similarities between the surgical disciplines, we often are at odds, trying to convince others of the superior aspects of a particular diagnostic and treatment approach.We forget the ultimate goal for many women of reproductive age, which requires consideration of the potential impact on fertility and using techniques to minimize any reduction in fecundity. We hear the Raja in our heads speak to each of us: \\'\\'Since each of us comes with a different perspective, if we put our heads (parts) together, we will together see the way (truth).\\'\\' As providers coming from diverse paths with training focused on different outcomes and pathophysiology, the nuances on clinical management regarding \\'\\'fertility-sparing surgery\\'\\' may be unique between subspecialists.In this month\\'s issue of Fertility & Sterility, Fertile Discussion, we review how each gynecologic surgical specialty may view frequently encountered clinical scenarios from a pre, intra, and postoperative management perspective and the roles that each play in women\\'s future fertility needs.\\n\\n==================================================\\n\\nFile: Boedt_et_al-2021-Cochrane_Database_of_Systematic_Reviews.grobid.tei.json\\nTitle: Preconception lifestyle advice for people with infertility\\nAuthors: Tessy [] Boedt, Anne-Catherine [] Vanhove, Melissa [\\'A\\'] Vercoe, Christophe [] Matthys, Eline [] Dancet, Sharon [] Lie Fong\\nAbstract: \\nBody Text: Infertility is a prevalent problem that has significant consequences for individuals, families, and the community.Modifiable lifestyle factors may a ect the chance of people with infertility having a baby.However, no guideline is available about what preconception advice should be o ered.It is important to determine what preconception advice should be given to people with infertility and to evaluate whether this advice helps them make positive behavioural changes to improve their lifestyle and their chances of conceiving. To assess the safety and e ectiveness of preconception lifestyle advice on fertility outcomes and lifestyle behavioural changes for people with infertility. We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register of controlled trials, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, AMED, CINAHL, trial registers, Google Scholar, and Epistemonikos in January 2021; we checked references and contacted field experts to identify additional studies. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), randomised cross-over studies, and cluster-randomised studies that compared at least one form of preconception lifestyle advice with routine care or attention control for people with infertility. We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane.Primary e ectiveness outcomes were live birth and ongoing pregnancy.Primary safety outcomes were adverse events and miscarriage.Secondary outcomes included reported behavioural changes in lifestyle, birth weight, gestational age, clinical pregnancy, time to pregnancy, quality of life, and male factor infertility outcomes.We assessed the overall quality of evidence using GRADE criteria. We included in the review seven RCTs involving 2130 participants.Only one RCT included male partners.Three studies compared preconception lifestyle advice on a combination of topics with routine care or attention control.Four studies compared preconception lifestyle advice on one topic (weight, alcohol intake, or smoking) with routine care for women with infertility and specific lifestyle Studies on preconception lifestyle advice on alcohol intake were identified only in at-risk drinking women with infertility.We are uncertain whether preconception lifestyle advice on alcohol intake a ects the number of live births (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.53 to 2.50; 1 RCT, 37 participants; very low-quality evidence) or miscarriages (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.21 to 8.34; 1 RCT, 37 participants; very low-quality evidence).One study reported on behavioural changes for alcohol consumption but not as defined in the review methods.No studies reported on adverse events or other behavioural changes. Studies on preconception lifestyle advice on smoking were identified only in smoking women with infertility.No studies reported on live birth, ongoing pregnancy, adverse events, or miscarriage.One study reported on behavioural changes for smoking but not as defined in the review methods. Low-quality evidence suggests that preconception lifestyle advice on a combination of topics may result in little to no di erence in the number of live births.Evidence was insu icient to allow conclusions on the e ects of preconception lifestyle advice on adverse events and miscarriage and on safety, as no studies were found that looked at these outcomes, or the studies were of very low quality.This review does not provide clear guidance for clinical practice in this area.However, it does highlight the need for high-quality RCTs to investigate preconception lifestyle advice on a combination of topics and to assess relevant e ectiveness and safety outcomes in men and women with infertility. Infertility places a significant burden on individuals, families, and the wider community and impacts more than 45 million couples worldwide.Treatment for infertility includes simple interventions such as fertility awareness and lifestyle advice (counselling about weight, diet, physical activity, and/or smoking) to more complex assisted reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF).Lifestyle factors such as weight, diet, physical activity, and smoking may a ect fertility and the chance of people with infertility having a baby.However, guidelines about what preconception lifestyle advice should be o ered are lacking. We wanted to find out the e ects of preconception lifestyle advice compared to routine care or attention control (e.g.treatment advice without lifestyle advice) for people with infertility. We searched for randomised controlled studies that compared preconception lifestyle advice for people with infertility with routine care or attention control. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. We were interested in finding out what preconception lifestyle advice should be given to people with infertility; how well it works for improving lifestyle to increase their chance of having a baby; and whether it had any unwanted e ects. We included evidence published up to 14 January 2021. We found seven studies in 2130 people with infertility.Only one study also included male partners.The studies were conducted in Canada, Iran, The Netherlands, UK, and USA.Three studies compared preconception lifestyle advice on a combination of topics with routine care or attention control.Four studies compared preconception lifestyle advice on one topic (weight, alcohol intake, or smoking) with routine care in women with infertility and specific lifestyle characteristics. Preconception lifestyle advice on a combination of topics may not a ect live birth.The evidence suggests that if live birth is assumed to be 48% for those receiving routine care or attention control, then live birth when preconception lifestyle advice is received would be between 38% and 53%.We are uncertain whether preconception lifestyle advice on a combination of topics a ects lifestyle behaviour changes such as body mass index (BMI) in women, vegetable intake in men and women, or alcohol abstinence and smoking cessation in men.Preconception lifestyle advice on a combination of topics may not a ect adequate use of folic acid supplement, alcohol abstinence, or smoking cessation in women.The evidence suggests that if adequate folic acid supplement use in women is assumed to be 93% for those receiving routine care or attention control, then adequate folic acid supplement use when preconception lifestyle advice is received would be between 89% and 94%.Evidence also suggests that if it is assumed that 75% of women abstain from alcohol with routine care or attention control, then between 74% and 88% of women would abstain from alcohol when receiving preconception lifestyle advice.If it is assumed that smoking cessation is seen in 95% of women receiving routine care or attention control, then smoking cessation would be seen in 93% to 99% of women when they receive preconception lifestyle advice.No study reported on other behavioural changes. We are uncertain whether preconception lifestyle advice on weight for women with infertility and obesity a ects live birth or adverse events (including gestational diabetes and hypertension) and miscarriage.Regarding behavioural changes, preconception lifestyle advice on weight may slightly reduce BMI, but we are uncertain whether it a ects other behavioural changes: percentage of weight loss, vegetable and fruit intake, alcohol intake, and total moderate to vigorous physical activity.No study reported on other behavioural changes. In at-risk drinking women with infertility, we are uncertain whether preconception lifestyle advice on alcohol intake a ects live birth or miscarriage.One study reported behavioural changes in alcohol intake but not as defined in the Review methods.No study reported on any other outcome. One study reported on preconception lifestyle advice with a focus on behavioural changes for smoking cessation in women with infertility who smoke, but not as defined in the Review methods.No study reported on any other outcome. The evidence was of low to very low quality.The main limitations of the evidence were poor study methods in included studies (lack of blinding) and lack of (precision in) findings for live birth, safety outcomes, and reported behavioural changes.Evidence is very uncertain about the effect on the number of men not smoking of preconception lifestyle advice on a combination of topics *The risk in the intervention group (and its 95% confidence interval) is based on the assumed risk in the comparison group and the relative effect of the intervention (and its 95% CI).BMI: body mass index; CI: confidence interval; MD: mean difference; RCT: randomised controlled trial; RR: risk ratio.

Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Infertility is defined as the failure to establish a clinical pregnancy a er 12 months of regular unprotected sexual intercourse (Zegers-Hochschild 2017).Worldwide, an estimated 48.5 million couples su er from fertility problems (Mascarenhas 2012) .Infertility may be due to male factors, female factors, or a combination of both, and in 20% of cases, the cause of infertility is unknown (Fritz 2011 The Fertility Society of Australia 2019).Treatment for people with infertility is referred to as medically assisted reproduction (MAR) and includes assisted reproductive technologies (ART) such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).These treatments have large financial and biopsychosocial costs for individuals and for the community (Gameiro 2012 Myers 2008) .Therefore, improving treatment success rates and reducing this burden are important research priorities in reproductive medicine (Gameiro 2013) . Modifiable lifestyle factors such as weight, diet, alcohol intake, ca eine intake, physical activity, smoking, and other substance abuse may a ect the chance of people with infertility having a live birth (Homan 2007 Rooney 2014) .Research suggests that these factors may have important e ects both during the preconception period and on the developing foetus (Atrash 2006 Bille 2009 World Health Organization 2012) .More specifically, Weeks 3 to 8 of pregnancy are the most sensitive in development of the embryo.Therefore, it is important to provide advice about modifying maternal and paternal factors before this period, to reduce the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes (Atrash 2006 Gardiner 2008 World Health Organization 2012) .Lifestyle factors that may a ect fertility and the chance of a live birth include weight, diet, alcohol intake, ca eine intake, physical activity, smoking, and other substance abuse (Government of South Australia 2015 Homan 2007 Practice Committee 2017 Rooney 2014 World Health Organization 2017) . Providing advice about which modifiable lifestyle factors a ect fertility is a crucial first step in helping people with infertility to make modifications that may increase their chances of timely conception and delivery of a healthy baby (Grainger 2006 Homan 2007 Moran 2016a; Shawe 2015; World Health Organization 2012) . Counselling about the aforementioned lifestyle factors may positively influence a couple\\'s behaviour before conceiving, and thus may improve their chance of achieving a live birth. For both women and men, fertility may decrease when they are overweight (body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25 kg/m ) or underweight (BMI < 18.5 kg/m ) (Campbell 2015 McKinnon 2016 Practice Committee 2015) .In addition, obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m ) in both women and men has substantial adverse e ects on general health but also on reproductive functions and the health of o spring (Campbell 2015 Godfrey 2017 Lane 2015 McKinnon 2016 Practice Committee 2015) .More specifically, obesity in women is associated with ovulatory dysfunction, reduced ovarian responsiveness to agents that induce ovulation, and lower birth rates.Indeed, fertility treatment is less successful in men and women who are overweight or obese as compared with normal weight couples (Campbell 2015 Rittenberg 2011) .Moreover obese women are at increased risk of developing maternal and foetal complications during pregnancy (Practice Committee 2015).Therefore, lifestyle modification is first-line treatment for women and men with obesity (Best 2017 Practice Committee 2015).It is recommended that people aiming to conceive should maintain a healthy weight, that is, should aim for BMI between 18.5 and 25 kg/m , by exercising regularly and following a healthy diet (Gardiner 2008 Government of South Australia 2015 Practice Committee 2017 World Health Organization 2016 World Health Organization 2017). Evidence suggests that adherence to a diet rich in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, fish, and poultry is related to better fertility and higher live birth rates among women and improved semen quality in men, and unhealthy diets may have the opposite e ect (Chiu 2018 Gaskins 2018a ; Giahi 2016 Grieger 2018 Salas-Huetos 2017 Vujkovic 2010) .Given this evidence and the significant benefits of a healthy diet for general health, women and men aiming to conceive should be encouraged to follow a healthy diet (World Health Organization 2016 World Health Organization 2017 World Health Organization 2020a). In addition to adherence to a healthy diet, some specific dietary recommendations have been provided for women during the preconception period.Maternal methylmercury exposure through eating predatory fish can a ect foetal development (McDiarmid 2008) .Thus, it has been recommended that women avoid eating shark, swordfish, king mackerel, and tile fish, and limit their intake of tuna during both the preconception period and pregnancy (Gardiner 2008 McDiarmid 2008) .Furthermore, it is recommended that pregnant women ensure that any fruits and vegetables are washed before eating; all perishable food is refrigerated correctly and consumed as soon as possible; and they do not eat so cheeses, unpasteurised milk, raw eggs, or undercooked meat (Government of South Australia 2015 Ross 2006 ).These food items may contain salmonella, toxoplasmosis, campylobacter, or listeria, which may cause infection and consequently adverse pregnancy outcomes. Regarding mineral intake, it is known that a mother\\'s iodine level a ects foetal neurological development.In many countries, iodine intake is inadequate.For women trying to conceive, this may lead to adverse e ects on a pregnancy and on the foetus (Harding 2017).However, until now, no clear e ects of iodine supplementation on maternal and foetal outcomes have been noted (Harding 2017).The general recommendation is that the general population, and pregnant women in particular, should enjoy a varied diet with adequate amounts of iodine (usually consumed through iodised salt and bread) (Government of South Australia 2015). Iron supplementation can prevent maternal anaemia and improve birth outcomes including birth weight (Haider 2017 World Health Organization 2012).Therefore, daily oral iron supplementation with 30 to 60 mg of elemental iron is recommended for pregnant women (World Health Organization 2017). Regarding vitamins, excessive vitamin A consumption through supplements or through crustacean or liver products during pregnancy can cause congenital defects, so it is recommended that women avoid these both before and during pregnancy (Government of South Australia 2015).Taking a daily folic acid (vitamin B9) supplement of 400 µg before conception and during Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews the first three months of pregnancy has been shown to decrease the risk of neural tube defects (such as spina bifida) in the foetus (De-Regil 2017) .Evidence from observational studies suggests that higher intake of folic acid may increase a woman\\'s chances of becoming pregnant (Gaskins 2018a) .Given this evidence, it is recommended that women be advised to take 400 µg of folic acid daily to help prevent foetal neural tube defects, starting as early as two months before they try to conceive (Government of South Australia 2015 Haider 2017 Practice Committee 2017 World Health Organization 2017). At this point, evidence-based recommendations or high-quality evidence on the intake of other vitamin or mineral supplements for improving fertility and chances of having a healthy live birth in men and women is lacking (Chiu 2018 Gaskins 2018a) . Antioxidants are biological and chemical compounds, including vitamins, minerals, and polyunsaturated fatty acids, that reduce oxidative damage.Low-to very low-quality evidence suggests that antioxidant supplementation in women with infertility may increase the chance of pregnancy or live birth rate (Showell 2020) . Low-quality evidence suggests that antioxidant supplementation for men with infertility may improve live birth rates (Smits 2019) .No recommendations for antioxidant supplementation are currently available for men and women aiming to conceive. Consuming high levels of alcohol (> 2 drinks per day, with 1 drink > 10 g of ethanol) can a ect both female and male fertility and the success of fertility treatment (Hakim 1998 Klono -Cohen 2003 Rossi 2011) .Additionally, alcohol has well-documented detrimental e ects on a foetus during pregnancy (Mukherjee 2005).Debate continues about the amount of alcohol that must be consumed before conception and pregnancy are a ected, but, given the severity of the consequences associated with overindulgence of alcohol, it has been recommended that people avoid drinking alcohol before conception, and that women should avoid alcohol throughout their pregnancy (Government of South Australia 2015 Homan 2007 Practice Committee 2017 World Health Organization 2017). Evidence on the association between consumption of ca eine and male and female fertility is inconclusive (Lyngso 2017 Ricci 2017) .Few studies have investigated the e ects of ca eine intake on people with infertility as a subpopulation, but no clear associations between ca eine intake and outcomes of fertility treatment have been found (Lyngso 2017) .However, consumption of high levels of ca eine (> 300 mg ca eine/d) during pregnancy has been associated with increased risk of spontaneous abortion (Lyngso 2017) .Thus, the recommendation has been made that people trying to conceive should limit their ca eine intake to the equivalent of less than two cups of co ee per day (Government of South Australia 2015 Homan 2007 Practice Committee 2017). Physical activity has a positive impact on one\\'s physical, emotional, and general health, and contributes to The use of non-prescription and recreational drugs before conception has been associated with reduced fertility in both men and women (Frey 2008 Fronczak 2012 Mueller 1990) .Due to the prevalence of poly-substance use, limited evidence is available on the independent e ects of these drugs on pregnancy outcomes.However, current data suggest that non-prescription and recreational drug use during pregnancy is associated with increased risk of foetal death, low birth weight, and preterm birth (Gouin 2011 Gunn 2016 Ladhani 2011 Metz 2017) .Given these data, it is recommended that people should be counselled to stop using non-prescription and recreational drugs before conception (Fronczak 2012 NICE 2013 Practice Committee 2017; World Health Organization 2014) . This is an update of a Cochrane Review that was first published in 2010.For the first version of this review, the search identified no RCTs that assessed e ects of preconception advice on the chance of live birth or other fertility outcomes in people with a diagnosis of infertility, and the need for further research into this topic was highlighted (Anderson 2010) .Over past years, fertility clinics have tended to see an increasing number of patients with an unhealthy lifestyle, and they have acknowledged more and more the importance of providing preconception lifestyle advice (Gormack 2015 Homan 2018) .The importance of providing preconception lifestyle advice is also reflected in the guidelines on routine psychosocial care in infertility and medically assisted reproduction of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) (ESHRE guideline 2015).However, clear and specific information is needed about what preconception advice related to these factors should be given to people presenting for fertility treatment, to help them make positive changes in the hope of improving their chances of conception and delivery of a healthy, live baby (Grainger 2006 Moran 2016a) .With increased attention to optimising preconception lifestyle advice for people with a diagnosis of infertility and continuous updates of the Methodological Expectations of Cochrane Intervention Reviews (MECIR), an update of this review is indispensable. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. To assess the safety and e ectiveness of preconception lifestyle advice on fertility outcomes and lifestyle behavioural changes for people with infertility. Criteria for considering studies for this review We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), randomised cross-over studies, and cluster-randomised studies.For cross-over trials, we had planned to include only data from the first phase (pre-cross-over data), as the cross-over is not a valid design in this context, but we identified no cross-over trials.We excluded nonrandomised studies, as they are associated with high risk of bias. Trials that included men or women with infertility in the following phases of treatment were eligible for inclusion. • Pretreatment: from diagnosis of infertility until initiation of fertility treatment.• During treatment: from initiation of fertility treatment until the end of fertility treatment. Trials that included solely women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) were excluded. RCTs considering at least one form of preconception lifestyle advice were eligible for inclusion.The preconception lifestyle advice had to be the main component of the intervention but could be combined with other care aspects that are not specified in the list below. Preconception lifestyle advice was defined as a combination of counselling about weight, diet, vitamin or mineral supplement intake, alcohol intake, ca eine intake, physical activity, smoking, and/or other substance abuse. • Setting: preconception lifestyle advice could be provided individually, per couple, or in a group setting.• Mode of delivery: preconception lifestyle advice could be provided face-to-face (F2F), through mobile applications, through the Internet, through telephone contact, or through written information in leaflets, booklets, or decision aids, and on websites, or by a combination of delivery modes.• Duration: the duration of preconception lifestyle advice could vary widely, from one session to multiple sessions.• Eligible comparisons consisted of routine care (either no preconception lifestyle advice or unstructured minimal preconception lifestyle advice) or attention control provided to groups. Primary outcomes • Live birth or ongoing pregnancy * Live birth defined as delivery of a live foetus a er 20 completed weeks of gestation * Ongoing pregnancy defined as evidence of a gestational sac with foetal heart motion at 12 weeks, confirmed by ultrasound * When studies reported both live birth and ongoing pregnancy, data on live birth were utilised • Any adverse event in men or women with infertility related to the intervention reported either as a composite measure or separately (including gestational diabetes and hypertension) Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews laboratory manual for examination and processing of human semen; World Health Organization 2010) If studies reported outcomes at di erent time points, the time point at the end of intervention was selected. We searched for all published and unpublished studies addressing preconception advice to influence lifestyle factors in people with the diagnosis of infertility.We applied no language restrictions, and we searched in consultation with the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group (CGFG) Information Specialist. We searched the following electronic databases for relevant trials: The search output was managed in Covidence (Covidence) . We handsearched reference lists of relevant trials and systematic reviews retrieved by the search and contacted experts in the field to obtain additional trials.We also handsearched relevant journals and conference abstracts that were not covered in the CGFG Register, in liaison with the Information Specialist. Three review authors (TB, ACV, MV) independently performed an initial screen of titles and abstracts retrieved by the search for potentially relevant studies.Each study was screened in duplicate.We retrieved the full texts of all potentially eligible studies, and three review authors independently examined these full-text articles for compliance with the inclusion criteria and to select eligible studies.We corresponded with study investigators as required, to clarify study eligibility.Disagreements were resolved by discussion, and, if necessary, the independent judgement of a senior review author (SLF) was sought.If any reports required translation, we described the process used for data collection.We documented the selection process with a \\'PRISMA\\' flow chart (Figure 1 ). Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Three review authors (TB, ACV, MV) independently extracted data from eligible studies using a data extraction form, which was designed by the authors in Covidence.Any disagreement was resolved by discussion and, if necessary, by consultation with a senior review author (SLF).Data extracted included study characteristics and outcome data (see data extraction table for details; Appendix 8).When studies had multiple publications, the review authors collated multiple reports of the same study under a single study ID with multiple references.We corresponded with study investigators to request further data on methods and/or results, as required. Three review authors (TB, ACV, MV) independently reviewed the included studies for risk of bias using the Cochrane \\'Risk of bias\\' assessment tool to assess selection (random sequence generation and allocation concealment); performance (blinding of participants and personnel); detection (blinding of outcome assessors); attrition (incomplete outcome data); reporting (selective reporting); and other bias.Judgements were assigned as recommended in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, Section 8.5 (Higgins 2020).We resolved disagreements by discussion.We described all judgements fully and presented conclusions in the \\'Risk of bias\\' table, which is incorporated into the interpretation of review findings by means of sensitivity analyses (see below).With respect to within-trial selective reporting, when identified studies failed to report the primary outcome of live birth but did report interim outcomes such as pregnancy, we assessed whether the interim values were similar to those reported in studies that also reported live birth. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. For dichotomous data (e.g.live birth rates), we used numbers of events in the control and intervention groups of each study to calculate Mantel-Haenszel risk ratios (RRs).For continuous data (e.g.birth weight), if all studies reported exactly the same outcomes, we calculated mean di erence (MDs) between treatment groups.If similar outcomes were reported on di erent scales (e.g.change in quality of life), we planned to calculate the standardised mean di erence (SMD), but no such data were identified.We treated ordinal data (e.g.quality of life scores) as continuous data.We planned to reverse the direction of e ect of individual studies, if required, to ensure consistency across trials, but we identified no such studies.We presented 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for all outcomes.When data to calculate RRs or MDs were not available, we utilised the most detailed numerical data available that facilitated similar analyses of included studies (e.g.test statistics, P values).We assessed whether estimates calculated in the review for individual studies were compatible in each case with estimates reported in the study publications. The primary analysis was per individual randomised; per pregnancy data were also included for some outcomes (e.g.miscarriage).If we encountered data that did not allow valid analysis (e.g.\"per cycle\" data), we planned to briefly summarise these in an additional table and to not perform meta-analysis, but we identified no such data.Multiple births were counted as one live birth event.We planned to include only first-phase data from cross-over trials, but we identified no cross-over trials.We planned to include data from cluster-randomised trials in the meta-analyses only if the reported outcome measure properly accounted for the cluster design, or if the necessary information was available to account for the clustering.If the intracluster correlation coe icient (ICC) was not reported, we planned to include the trial only if an ICC could be obtained from similar studies (Higgins 2020 Rao 1992 ).However, we found no data from cluster-randomised trials, and this analysis was not performed. We analysed the data on an intention-to-treat basis as far as possible (i.e.including all randomised participants in analysis, in the groups to which they were randomised).We attempted to obtain missing data from the original studies.When these were not obtainable, we undertook imputation of individual values for live birth or ongoing pregnancy only: live birth or ongoing pregnancy was assumed not to have occurred in participants without a reported outcome.For other outcomes, we analysed only available data.Any imputation undertaken was subjected to sensitivity analysis (see below).If studies reported su icient detail to calculate mean di erences but no information on associated standard deviation (SD), we assumed the outcome to have a standard deviation equal to the highest SD from other studies within the same analysis, but we identified no such studies. We considered whether the clinical and methodological characteristics of included studies were su iciently similar for meta-analysis to provide a clinically meaningful summary.We assessed heterogeneity by inspecting the forest plot and by using the Chi -test and the I statistic.An I measurement greater than 50% was taken to indicate substantial heterogeneity (Higgins 2020).If heterogeneity was substantial, we examined the direction of e ects before making a decision whether to report the pooled result or to describe the e ects narratively. In view of the di iculty of detecting and correcting for publication bias and other reporting biases, we aimed to minimise their potential impact by ensuring a comprehensive search for eligible studies and by being alert for duplication of data.If ten or more studies were included in an analysis, we planned to use a funnel plot to explore the possibility of small-study e ects (i.e. a tendency for estimates of the intervention e ect to be more beneficial in smaller studies), but for each comparison, we identified only one study or a few studies. If studies were su iciently similar, we attempted to combine the data using a random-e ects model for the following comparisons. • Preconception advice versus no preconception advice for a combination of any of the following topics: weight, diet, vitamin or mineral supplement intake, alcohol intake, ca eine intake, physical activity, smoking, and/or other substance abuse.• Preconception advice versus no preconception advice for one of the aforementioned topics.Each of the topics was analysed as a separate comparison. A narrative review summary format was chosen as the method for synthesis when it was not possible to conduct meta-analyses.In this case, MDs were presented for continuous outcomes and RRs for dichotomous outcomes without pooling. For the secondary outcomes on reported behavioural changes, decision rules based on guidance documents and clinical considerations were followed in selecting outcomes for inclusion in our synthesis, as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2020).In general, if continuous and dichotomous outcomes were reported (e.g.vegetable intake in grams/d versus number of participants with adequate vegetable intake > 200 grams/d), preference was given to continuous outcomes, and study authors were contacted to provide us with these data.If composite scores and individual component scores on behavioural changes were reported, preference was given to inclusion of individual component scores. For example, one study reported on a combination of reported behavioural changes in diet, more specifically, a dietary risk score (DRS) from 0 to 9 (the lower, the better) comprising intake of vegetables, fruits, and folic acid supplement; and on a lifestyle risk score (LRS) from 0 to 9 (the lower, the better) comprising alcohol intake and smoking (Oostingh 2020).Study authors also reported on these individual components, and preference was given to inclusion of these outcomes in our synthesis.We further specified that if outcomes were measured at multiple time points within a time frame, we would select the time point at the end of the intervention. If we detected substantial heterogeneity, and if data were su icient, we planned to use subgroup analyses to consider di erences between studies that might account for heterogeneity (e.g. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews di erences in study populations, therapy settings, timing, design, delivery of the intervention).Due to the limited number of studies identified for each comparison, we were not able to perform subgroup analyses.We took any statistical heterogeneity into account when interpreting the results, especially if there was any variation in the direction of e ect. We planned to conduct sensitivity analyses for the primary outcomes to determine whether the conclusions were robust to arbitrary decisions made regarding eligibility and analysis.These analyses included consideration of whether the review conclusions would have di ered if: • eligibility had been restricted to studies at low risk of bias, defined as studies at low risk for sequence generation and allocation concealment, and not at high risk of bias in any domain; • a fixed-e ect model had been adopted; • alternative imputation strategies had been implemented for missing data; • the summary e ect measure had been odds ratio rather than risk ratio; or • the primary outcome had been live birth rather than live birth or ongoing pregnancy. Due to the limited number of studies identified for each comparison, we performed sensitivity analyses only on model and summary e ect measures. We prepared a \\'Summary of findings\\' table using GRADEpro so ware and Cochrane methods (Higgins 2020).This table shows the overall quality of the body of evidence for the main review outcomes (live birth or ongoing pregnancy, any adverse event, miscarriage, and reported behavioural changes) for the main review comparison (combination of weight, diet, vitamin or mineral supplement intake, alcohol intake, ca eine intake, physical activity, smoking, and/or other substance abuse preconception advice versus no preconception advice). We prepared additional \\'Summary of findings\\' tables for the main review outcomes for each of the other comparisons in our data synthesis. We assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE criteria: risk of bias, consistency of e ect, imprecision, indirectness, and publication bias.Judgements about evidence quality (high, moderate, low, or very low) were made by two review authors (TB, ACV) working independently, with disagreements resolved by discussion.Judgements were justified, documented, and incorporated into reporting of results for each outcome.We extracted study data, formatted our comparisons in data tables, and prepared a \\'Summary of findings\\' table before writing the results and conclusions of our review. We included seven parallel-design RCTs with a total of 2130 participants, including Hughes 2000, which was the only included study in the 2010 version of this systematic review (Anderson 2010) .All studies defined preconception lifestyle advice as the intervention, whereas the control group received routine care or attention control.In two studies, routine care consisted of immediate start of fertility treatment and information according to local protocols (Belan 2019 Mutsaerts 2016).In both studies, the intervention group first received lifestyle intervention so that fertility treatment was postponed within six months.In the other studies, there was no di erence in access to fertility treatment between intervention and control groups.In four studies, participants in the control group received routine care consisting of unstructured minimal preconception lifestyle advice or assessment, including advice on modern dietary recommendations (Alibeigi 2020), standard care information about the impact of smoking on fertility and exhaled carbon monoxide measurements (Hughes 2000), standard preconception advice o ered online by national health services (Ng 2018), or assessment of current alcohol consumption and general health in an assessment interview (Rossi 2013) .One study compared the intervention with an attention control to adjust for the benefit of attention.For the latter group, lifestyle assessment was conducted with a questionnaire at baseline and at three and six months without feedback, with access to a personal page and one seasonal recipe per week (Oostingh 2020). All studies described their interventions in their publications; only Mutsaerts 2016 provided a full reproducible protocol on how the intervention was built. Studies were heterogeneous with respect to outcomes measured. 2016) .Additionally, one study reported on a combination of reported behavioural changes in diet, more specifically, a dietary risk score (DRS) from 0 to 9 (the lower, the better) comprising intake of vegetables, fruits, and folic acid supplement (Oostingh 2020). Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Two studies reported on change in vitamin or mineral supplement intake, more specifically, the number of women with adequate folic acid supplement use (Ng 2018 Oostingh 2020). Three studies reported on stopping/reducing alcohol intake via self-report questionnaires such as FFQ (Mutsaerts 2016), a selfvalidated online lifestyle questionnaire (Oostingh 2020), and the Alcohol Timeline Followback questionnaire (Rossi 2013) .A variety of outcome measures were reported in these studies including alcoholic beverages in glasses per day (Mutsaerts 2016), the number of participants not drinking alcohol (Oostingh 2020), decrease in the number of drinks on a drinking day, decrease in percentage of drinking days in the past six months, decrease in the number of weeks of drinking above the daily safety limit in the past six months, and decrease in the number of binges in the past six months (Rossi 2013) . No studies reported on reduction of ca eine intake. Two studies reported on increase in physical activity, one of which used a triaxial accelerometer to measure changes in total leisure activity energy expenditure in kcal/kg/d (Belan 2019); the other study used the Short Questionnaire to Assess Health-Enhancing Physical Activity (SQUASH) to measure total minutes per week in moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) including leisuretime physical activity and commuting activities (Mutsaerts 2016). Two studies reported on stopping smoking and other substance abuse.One study reported the rate of maintained smoking cessation at 12 months and the delta stage of change towards smoking cessation (di erence in stage of motivation to change smoking behaviour) (Hughes 2000) .The other study reported on the number of participants not smoking before and a er the intervention (Oostingh 2020). Additionally, one study reported on a combination of lifestyle behavioural changes, more specifically, a lifestyle risk score (LRS) from 0 to 9 (the lower, the better) comprising alcohol intake and smoking (Oostingh 2020). With respect to the other secondary outcomes, two studies reported on birth weight and gestational age (Belan 2019 Mutsaerts 2016).Four studies reported on clinical pregnancy with a variety of definitions, including pregnancy confirmed by ultrasound (Alibeigi 2020), evidence of a foetal heartbeat on ultrasound or pregnancy exceeding 12 weeks (Belan 2019), and evidence of a gestational sac confirmed by ultrasound (Mutsaerts 2016).One study reported clinical pregnancy rates without further definition (Oostingh 2020).Time points for measuring clinical pregnancy varied from 12 months in Oostingh 2020 to 24 months in Mutsaerts 2016 a er randomisation.One study did not report the time point of measurement (Alibeigi 2020). One study reported on time to pregnancy leading to live birth (Mutsaerts 2016). One study reported on quality of life using the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) (Mutsaerts 2016). No studies reported on male factor infertility outcomes. We excluded 137 records from the review a er consideration of full text for the following reasons (see also Characteristics of excluded studies table ). • 29 records on the basis of study design (not RCTs). • See Figure 2 and Figure 3 for an overview on risk of bias and the \\'Risk of bias\\' table under Characteristics of included studies. Six studies were rated at low risk of selection bias related to sequence generation, as they used computer-generated randomisation or a random numbers table (Belan 2019 Hughes  2000 Mutsaerts 2016 Ng 2018 Oostingh 2020 Rossi 2013 ).One study was rated at unclear risk of selection bias of sequence generation (Alibeigi 2020).Study authors describe the use of block randomisation but fail to specify the process of selecting the blocks.We contacted the study authors to clarify the randomisation procedure, but we did not receive a reply. Five studies were rated at low risk of selection bias related to allocation concealment, as they used sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes or central randomisation by a third party (Belan 2019 Hughes 2000 Mutsaerts 2016 Ng 2018 Oostingh 2020).Two studies did not describe the methods of allocation concealment, and no reply was received when we contacted study authors for clarification.These two studies were rated at unclear risk of this bias (Alibeigi 2020 Rossi 2013). In all studies, participants were aware of the assigned interventions, as it is di icult to blind participants to behavioural interventions such as preconception lifestyle advice.In two studies, it is not clear if personnel were also blinded during the intervention (Ng 2018 Oostingh 2020).In the other five studies, personnel were aware of the assigned interventions (Alibeigi 2020 Belan 2019 Hughes 2000 Mutsaerts 2016 Rossi 2013).Deviations from the intended intervention could have arisen in all studies, for example, di erential behaviours across groups such as the control group seeking preconception advice outside the study setting, or di erential administration of co-interventions by personnel.We therefore rated all studies at high risk of performance bias. We considered that not blinding outcome assessors was unlikely to influence the primary review outcomes (live birth, ongoing pregnancy, adverse events, and miscarriage) and certain secondary outcomes, including birth weight, gestational age, clinical pregnancy, and time to pregnancy.These are observer-reported outcome measures not involving judgement.Five studies were rated at low risk of detection bias for these outcomes (Alibeigi 2020 Belan 2019 Mutsaerts 2016 Oostingh 2020 Rossi 2013).Not blinding outcome assessors might influence male factor infertility outcomes, as these are observer-reported outcomes involving judgement, but no studies reported on this outcome measure.Not blinding outcome assessors might influence patient-reported outcome measures such as e ects of reported behavioural changes on diet, vitamin or mineral supplement intake, alcohol intake, ca eine intake, physical activity, smoking, and quality of life, as participants could report more socially desirable answers for these outcomes.Six studies reported on patient-reported outcome measures for which the participant was the outcome assessor and was not blinded.Therefore, these studies had high risk of detection bias for these outcomes (Belan 2019 Hughes 2000 Mutsaerts 2016 Ng 2018 Oostingh 2020 Rossi 2013). Two studies were reported as conference abstracts with limited available data, in which missing outcome data were not (yet) described (Belan 2019 Ng 2018).We therefore rated these studies at unclear risk of attrition bias at this point.Two studies failed to report the number of participants lost to follow-up (Hughes 2000 Rossi 2013) .However, Rossi 2013 provided data on 37 participants, whereas 161 patients with infertility were initially included.This study was rated at high risk of attrition bias.We contacted the study authors for clarification but did not receive a reply.Three studies reported discontinuation of the intervention and/or losses to follow-up but used intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis (Alibeigi 2020 Mutsaerts 2016 Oostingh 2020).In Alibeigi 2020, missing data and reasons for discontinuation were documented and were balanced between groups (five in the intervention group, six in the control group), and all randomised women were included in the ITT analysis.This study was rated at low risk of attrition bias. In Mutsaerts 2016 and Oostingh 2020, discontinuation was not balanced between groups.In Mutsaerts 2016, discontinuation was 21.8% in the intervention group.Study authors did not impute on ITT for those who withdrew consent (one in the intervention group, two in the control group) and for those lost to follow-up (nine in the intervention group, one in the control group).In our analysis, we assumed that these dropouts did not have a live birth. Because the reasons for discontinuation of the intervention were well documented and were consistent with the statistical plan of 20% discontinuation of the intervention and 5% loss to follow-up, we rated this study at low risk of attrition bias (Mutsaerts 2016). In Oostingh 2020, discontinuation in the intervention group was 30.2% versus 18.2% in the control group.Study authors did not impute on ITT for those lost to follow-up (13 in the intervention group, 14 in the control group), but we assumed in our analysis that these participants did not have a clinical pregnancy.Reasons for discontinuation of the intervention or control were not reported.Therefore, we rated risk of attrition bias as unclear (Oostingh 2020).We considered studies to be at low risk of reporting bias if a protocol was prospectively registered and live birth or ongoing pregnancy was included as an outcome measure.We therefore rated Mutsaerts 2016 at low risk of reporting bias.Six studies were rated at high risk of reporting bias (Alibeigi 2020 Belan 2019 Hughes 2000 Ng 2018 Oostingh 2020 Rossi 2013).Alibeigi 2020 had a prospectively registered protocol but did not report on live birth or ongoing pregnancy.In addition, data on dietary behaviour were measured but were not reported.The study details of Hughes 2000 could not be verified, as no study protocol was available and the study was not prospectively registered.Additionally, these investigators did not report on live birth or ongoing pregnancy, and some data on smoking (carbon monoxide (CO) measurements) were measured but were not reported.Two studies were reported in conference abstracts and did not report all pre-specified outcomes at this point.(Belan 2019 Ng 2018).Oostingh 2020 had an unreported pre-specified outcome (Big 3 complications including small-forgestational-age, premature birth, and congenital malformations) Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and reported an outcome (lifestyle risk score) not specified in the protocol.Finally, Rossi 2013 was not prospectively registered.Although these study authors did report on live birth, they did not report on quality of life (a pre-specified outcome), and baseline data on alcohol intake were missing (Rossi 2013) . One study was rated at high risk of other bias, as it was an interim analysis (Ng 2018).Another study was rated at unclear risk of other bias, as it was not clear which lifestyle questionnaire was used, and if this questionnaire had been validated (Oostingh 2020).We found no potential sources of within-study bias in the other studies. See: Summary of findings 1 Preconception lifestyle advice on a combination of topics compared to routine care or attention control for people with infertility; Summary of findings 2 Preconception lifestyle advice on weight compared to routine care or attention control for people with infertility and obesity; Summary of findings 3 Preconception lifestyle advice on alcohol intake compared to routine care or attention control for atrisk drinking women with infertility; Summary of findings 4 Preconception lifestyle advice on smoking compared to routine care or attention control for people with infertility See Summary of findings 1 for the main comparison preconception lifestyle advice on a combination of any of the following topics: weight, diet, vitamin or mineral supplement intake, alcohol intake, ca eine intake, physical activity, smoking, and/or other substance abuse compared with routine care or attention control for people with infertility. Comparison 1. Preconception lifestyle advice on a combination of any of the following topics: weight, diet, vitamin or mineral supplement intake, alcohol intake, ca eine intake, physical activity, smoking, and/or other substance abuse versus routine care or attention control See Summary of findings 1. One study reported on the number of live births and compared preconception lifestyle advice on a combination of topics with attention control (Oostingh 2020). Preconception lifestyle advice on a combination of topics may result in little to no di erence in the number of live births (risk ratio (RR) 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79 to 1.10; 1 RCT, 626 participants; low-quality evidence).This suggests that if the proportion of live births is assumed to be 48% in the control group, then the proportion of live births when preconception lifestyle advice is received would be between 38% and 53% (Analysis 1.1). No studies reported on adverse events. No studies reported on miscarriage. No studies reported on lifestyle behavioural changes in ca eine intake and physical activity. One study reported on BMI and compared preconception lifestyle advice on a combination of topics with routine care (Alibeigi 2020). We are uncertain whether preconception lifestyle advice on a combination of topics a ects BMI in women compared to routine care (mean di erence (MD) -1.06 kg/m , 95% CI -2.33 to 0.21; 1 RCT, 180 participants; very low-quality evidence) (Analysis 1.2). Two studies reported on behavioural changes in diet (Ng 2018 Oostingh 2020).Ng 2018 compared preconception lifestyle advice on a combination of topics with routine care, and Oostingh 2020 compared this with attention control.Only Ng 2018 reported on behavioural changes in diet (vegetable intake in g/day) as defined in the review methods. We are uncertain whether preconception lifestyle advice on a combination of topics a ects vegetable intake (MD 12.50 grams/ d, 95% CI -8.43 to 33.43; 1 RCT, 264 participants; very low-quality evidence) (Analysis 1.3). Additionally, Ng 2018 reported on fruit intake in pieces/d: MD 0.80, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.24 in 164 women with infertility.Oostingh 2020 reported on the number of participants with adequate intake of vegetables (> 200 grams/d) and fruit (> 2 pieces/d).For the number of participants with adequate intake of vegetables, the RR was 1.46, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.82 in 612 women with infertility, and was 1.42, 95% CI 0.96 to 2.08 in 216 male partners.For the number of participants with adequate fruit intake, study authors reported an RR of 1.18, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.33 in 612 women with infertility, and an RR of 1.57, 95% CI 1.21 to 2.04 in 216 male partners.Table 1 presents an overview of additional behavioural changes not reported according to the definition in the review methods. Two studies reported on the number of women with adequate use of folic acid supplement (Ng 2018 Oostingh 2020).Ng 2018 compared preconception lifestyle advice on a combination of topics with routine care, and Oostingh 2020 compared this with attention control. Preconception lifestyle advice on a combination of topics may result in little to no di erence in the number of women with adequate use of folic acid supplement (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.01; 2 RCTs, 850 participants; I = 4%; low-quality evidence).This suggests that if the proportion of women with adequate use of folic acid supplement is assumed to be 93% in the control group, then the proportion of women with adequate use of folic acid supplement when preconception lifestyle advice is received would be between 89% and 94% (Analysis 1.4). Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. One study reported on the number of men and women abstaining from alcohol and compared preconception lifestyle advice on a combination of topics with attention control (Oostingh 2020). Preconception lifestyle advice on a combination of topics may result in little to no di erence in the proportion of women abstaining from alcohol (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.17; 1 RCT, 607 participants; low-quality evidence).This suggests that if the number of women abstaining from alcohol is assumed to be 75% in the control group, then the number of women abstaining from alcohol when receiving preconception lifestyle advice would be between 74% and 88% (Analysis 1.5). We are uncertain whether preconception lifestyle advice on a combination of topics a ects the number of men abstaining from alcohol (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.58; 1 RCT, 210 participants; very low-quality evidence). The same study reported on the numbers of men and women not smoking a er preconception lifestyle advice on a combination of topics compared with attention control (Oostingh 2020). Preconception lifestyle advice on a combination of topics may result in little to no di erence in the proportion of women not smoking (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.04; 1 RCT, 606 participants; lowquality evidence).This suggests that if the proportion of women not smoking is assumed to be 95.1% in the control group, then the number of women not smoking when preconception lifestyle advice is received would be between 93% and 99% (Analysis 1.6). We are uncertain whether preconception lifestyle advice on a combination of topics a ects the number of men not smoking (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.12; 1 RCT, 212 participants; very low-quality evidence). No studies reported on birth weight. No studies reported on gestational age. Two studies reported on clinical pregnancy and compared preconception lifestyle advice on a combination of topics to routine care (Alibeigi 2020), or to attention control (Oostingh 2020). Oostingh 2020 reported the percentage of clinical pregnancy at 12 months without specifying a definition for clinical pregnancy. On request, the study authors provided the number of clinical pregnancies that was included in the analysis.Considerable statistical heterogeneity (P = 0.0003 and I = 92%) and clinical heterogeneity between intervention and comparison were evident.Therefore, the data from these two studies were not pooled for this outcome, as this would not result in a clinically meaningful estimate of the treatment e ect (Analysis 1.7). Due to very low-quality evidence, we are uncertain whether preconception lifestyle advice on a combination of topics a ects the number of clinical pregnancies.Alibeigi 2020 reported an RR of 2.85 (95% CI 1.53 to 5.29) in 180 participants.Oostingh 2020 reported an RR of 0.92 (95% CI 0.81 to 1.05) in 626 participants. No studies reported on time to pregnancy. No studies reported on quality of life. No studies reported on male factor infertility outcomes. See Summary of findings 2. Studies identified for this comparison included only women with infertility and a specific lifestyle characteristic (e.g.being overweight or obese) (Belan 2019 Mutsaerts 2016). Two studies reported on live birth among women with infertility and obesity and compared preconception lifestyle advice on weight to routine care (Belan 2019 Mutsaerts 2016).Belan 2019 reported percentages of live birth, which we were able to recalculate to numbers of live births. We are uncertain whether preconception lifestyle advice on weight a ects the numbers of live births in women with infertility and obesity (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.43; 2 RCTs, 707 participants; I = 68%; very low-quality evidence).The evidence suggests that if the chance of live birth is assumed to be 49% in the control group, then the chance of live birth when preconception lifestyle advice is received would be between 30% and 70% (Analysis 2.1). Sensitivity analyses were performed including changing the random-e ects model to a fixed-e ect model and changing RR to OR; these changes did not alter the overall e ect. Two studies reported on adverse events including gestational diabetes and hypertension in women with infertility and obesity and compared preconception lifestyle advice on weight to routine care (Belan 2019 Mutsaerts 2016). No data on adverse events could be extracted from Belan 2019.These study authors stated that \"groups did not di er for the rate of gestational diabetes or preeclampsia.\"We contacted study authors for more information, but we did not receive any reply as of the time of submission (February 2021). We are uncertain whether preconception lifestyle advice on weight a ects the numbers of adverse events including gestational diabetes (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.48 to Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 16% in the control group, then the chances when preconception lifestyle advice is received would be between 10% and 25% for gestational diabetes, and between 11% and 28% for hypertension (Analysis 2.2). One study reported on miscarriage as the number of losses of clinical pregnancy at gestational age < 16 weeks in women with infertility and obesity and compared preconception lifestyle advice on weight to routine care (Mutsaerts 2016). We are uncertain whether preconception lifestyle advice on weight a ects the numbers of miscarriages in women with infertility and obesity (RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.37; 1 RCT, 577 participants; very low-quality evidence).Evidence suggests that if the chance of miscarriage is assumed to be 9% in the control group, then the chance of live birth when preconception lifestyle advice is received would be between 9% and 22% (Analysis 2.3). No studies reported on lifestyle behavioural changes in vitamin or mineral supplement intake, ca eine intake, smoking, or other substance abuse a er preconception lifestyle advice on weight. In the comparison of preconception lifestyle advice on weight to routine care, two studies reported on behavioural changes in weight in women with infertility and obesity (Belan 2019 Mutsaerts 2016).These studies used di erent parameters to report this outcome: change in BMI and weight (Mutsaerts 2016); and percentage of weight loss (Belan 2019).A minimal data set was provided by the authors of the first study (Mutsaerts 2016), so we were able to recalculate weight into the percentage of weight loss (mean ± SD). Preconception lifestyle advice on weight may slightly reduce the BMI in women with infertility and obesity (MD -1.30 kg/m , 95% CI -1.58 to -1.02; 1 RCT, 574 participants; low-quality evidence) (Analysis 2.5). We are uncertain whether preconception lifestyle advice on weight a ects the percentage of weight loss in women with infertility and obesity (MD -3.29%, 95% CI -4.34 to -2.24; 2 RCTs, 380 participants; I = 24%, very low-quality evidence) (Analysis 2.4). The same two studies in women with infertility and obesity reported on behavioural changes in diet (Belan 2019 Mutsaerts 2016).Only Mutsaerts 2016 reported on behavioural changes in diet (vegetable and fruit intake in grams/d) as defined in the review methods. We are uncertain whether preconception lifestyle advice on weight a ects vegetable intake (MD 0.00 grams/d, 95% CI -4.18 to 4.18; 1 RCT, 250 participants; very low-quality evidence) and fruit intake (MD -7.25 grams/d, 95% CI -7.86 to -6.64; 1 RCT, 258 participants; very low-quality evidence) in women with infertility and obesity (Analysis 2.6 Analysis 2.7). Belan 2019 reported on a healthy eating score adapted from the USA\\'s healthy eating index, whereas Mutsaerts 2016 reported on the median intake of vegetables, fruits, sugary drinks, savoury snacks, and sweet snacks.Table 1 presents an overview of additional behavioural changes not reported according to the definition in the review methods. One study reported on the median intake of alcoholic beverages expressed as glasses/d in women with infertility and obesity and compared preconception lifestyle advice on weight to routine care (Mutsaerts 2016).A minimal data set was provided by the study authors and values were recalculated to mean ± SD.The mean intake of alcoholic beverages was 0 glasses/d in the control group and 0.02 ± 0.016 glasses/d in the intervention group, hence the mean di erence was not estimable. We are uncertain whether preconception lifestyle advice on weight decreases alcohol intake in women with infertility and obesity (MD not estimable; 1 RCT, 239 participants; very low-quality evidence) (Analysis 2.8). Two studies in women with infertility and obesity reported on behavioural changes in physical activity and compared preconception lifestyle advice on weight to routine care (Belan 2019 Mutsaerts 2016).Only Mutsaerts 2016 reported on behavioural changes in physical activity as defined in the review methods.In this study, physical activity was defined as the median minutes spent in moderate to vigorous physical activity per week, which we were able to recalculate to mean values. We are uncertain whether preconception lifestyle advice on weight a ects the total moderate to vigorous physical activity (MD 50.76 minutes/week, 95% CI 16.77 to 84.75; 1 RCT, 254 participants; very low-quality evidence) (Analysis 2.9). Belan 2019 reported on total leisure activity energy expenditure in kcal/kg/d: MD 0.60 kcal/kg/d, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.18, in 97 women with infertility and obesity (Table 1 ). Two studies in women with infertility and obesity reported on birth weight and compared preconception lifestyle advice on weight to routine care (Belan 2019 Mutsaerts 2016) . No data on birth weight could be extracted from Belan 2019.These study authors stated, \"there was no significant di erence between groups for weight at birth.\"We contacted the study authors for more information, but we did not receive any reply as of the time of submission (February 2021). Median birth weight was reported by Mutsaerts 2016.A minimal data set was provided by the study authors; therefore we were able to recalculate mean values and a mean di erence. We are uncertain whether preconception lifestyle advice on weight a ects birth weight in women with infertility and obesity (MD -29.00 g, 95% CI -39.12 to -18.88; One study reported on time to pregnancy leading to live birth, comparing preconception lifestyle advice on weight to routine care (Mutsaerts 2016).A minimal data set was provided by the study authors, so we were able to calculate the mean (± SD) time to pregnancy and the hazard ratio (HR) from the Kaplan-Meier curve. Mean time to pregnancy in the intervention group was 19.31 ± 0.67 months and in the control group 16.81 ± 0.73 months. Delaying the start of fertility treatment to give preconception lifestyle advice on weight might slightly increase the time to pregnancy in women with infertility and obesity (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.99; 1 RCT, 561 participants; low-quality evidence) (Analysis 2.14). One study reported on the mental and physical quality of life in women and compared preconception lifestyle advice on weight to routine care (Mutsaerts 2016).A minimal data set was provided by the study authors; therefore we were able to calculate the mean (± SD) quality of life. We are uncertain whether preconception lifestyle advice on weight a ects the mental quality of life in women with infertility and obesity (MD -0. No studies reported on male factor infertility outcomes. Comparison 3. Preconception lifestyle advice on one topic: alcohol intake versus routine care or attention control See Summary of findings 3. The identified study for this comparison included only women with infertility and a specific lifestyle characteristic (e.g.at-risk alcohol drinking) (Rossi 2013) . One study reported on live birth a er preconception lifestyle advice on alcohol intake as compared with routine care (Rossi 2013) . We are uncertain whether preconception lifestyle advice on alcohol intake a ects the number of live births in at-risk drinking women with infertility (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.53 to 2.50; 1 RCT, 37 participants; very low-quality evidence).Evidence suggests that if the chance of live birth is assumed to be 38% in the control group, then the chance of live birth when preconception lifestyle advice is received would be between 20% and 95% (Analysis 3.1). No studies reported on adverse events. That same study in at-risk drinking women with infertility reported on miscarriage and compared preconception lifestyle advice on alcohol intake to routine care (Rossi 2013) . We are uncertain whether preconception lifestyle advice on alcohol intake a ects miscarriage in at-risk drinking women with infertility (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.21 to 8.34; 1 RCT, 37 participants; very low-quality evidence).Evidence suggests that if the chance of miscarriage is assumed to be 10% in the control group, then the chance of miscarriage when preconception lifestyle advice is received would be between 2% and 79% (Analysis 3.2). No studies reported on lifestyle behavioural changes in weight, diet, vitamin or mineral supplement intake, ca eine intake, physical activity, smoking, or other substance abuse. Behavioural changes in alcohol intake were reported in the same study in at-risk drinking women with infertility (Rossi 2013) . Behavioural changes in alcohol intake were not reported as defined in the review methods; however surrogate outcomes on alcohol consumption were provided. No studies reported on birth weight. No studies reported on gestational age. No studies reported on clinical pregnancy. No studies reported on time to pregnancy. No studies reported on quality of life. No studies reported on male factor infertility outcomes. See Summary of findings 4. The study identified for this comparison included only women with infertility and a specific lifestyle characteristic (e.g.smoking three or more cigarettes per day over the last six months) (Hughes 2000) . No studies reported on live birth or ongoing pregnancy. No studies reported on adverse events. No studies reported on miscarriage No studies reported on lifestyle behavioural changes in weight, diet, vitamin or mineral supplement intake, alcohol intake, ca eine intake, or physical activity. One study reported on behavioural changes in smoking habits and compared preconception lifestyle advice on smoking to routine care (Hughes 2000) .Study authors did not use outcome measures as defined in the review methods but reported delta stage of change (di erence in stage of motivation to change smoking behaviour) and rate of maintained smoking cessation at 12 months in women with infertility who smoked three or more cigarettes over the past six months (Table 1 ).The mean delta stage of change was 0.31 for the experimental group and 0.26 for the control group.Mean di erences could not be calculated, as study authors did not report standard deviations, CIs, or P values.In their study, the study authors concluded, \"there were no significant di erences in the mean delta stage of change or 12-month rate of maintained cessation.\"The rate of maintained cessation was not reported separately for intervention and control groups. No studies reported on birth weight. No studies reported on gestational age. No studies reported on clinical pregnancy. No studies reported on time to pregnancy. No studies reported on quality of life. No studies reported on male factor infertility outcomes. We found seven randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing preconception lifestyle advice with routine care or attention control in a total of 2130 women and men with infertility. Only one of these RCTs also included male partners.Three studies compared preconception lifestyle advice on a combination of topics with routine care or attention control.Four studies compared preconception lifestyle advice on one topic (weight, alcohol intake, or smoking) with routine care in women with infertility and specific lifestyle characteristics.The summary of finding tables present the main outcomes. Low-quality evidence suggests that preconception lifestyle advice on a combination of topics may result in little to no di erence in the number of live births. No studies reported on adverse events or miscarriage. Regarding lifestyle behavioural changes, we are uncertain whether preconception lifestyle advice on a combination of topics a ects body mass index (BMI) and vegetable intake due to very low-quality evidence.Low-quality evidence suggests that preconception lifestyle advice on a combination of topics may result in little to no di erence in the number of women with adequate use of folic acid supplement, abstaining from alcohol, and not smoking.One study reported on the number of men abstaining from alcohol and not smoking, but the evidence was of very low quality. No studies reported behavioural changes in ca eine intake and physical activity. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Due to very low-quality evidence, we are uncertain whether preconception lifestyle advice on a combination of topics a ects the number of clinical pregnancies.No studies reported on birth weight, gestational age, time to pregnancy, quality of life, or male factor infertility outcomes. Due to very low-quality evidence, we are uncertain whether preconception lifestyle advice on weight a ects the number of live births, the number of adverse events including gestational diabetes and hypertension, and the number of miscarriages in women with infertility and obesity. Regarding lifestyle behavioural changes, low-quality evidence suggests that preconception lifestyle advice on weight may slightly reduce the BMI of women with infertility and obesity. We are uncertain whether preconception lifestyle advice on weight a ects the percentage of weight loss, vegetable and fruit intake, alcohol intake, and total moderate to vigorous physical activity in women with infertility and obesity due to very low-quality evidence.No studies reported behavioural changes in vitamin or mineral supplement intake, ca eine intake, smoking, or other substance abuse.Due to very low-quality evidence, we are uncertain whether preconception lifestyle advice on weight a ects birth weight, gestational age, clinical pregnancy, and quality of life in women with infertility and obesity. Low-quality evidence suggests that delaying the start of fertility treatment to give preconception lifestyle advice on weight may slightly increase the time to pregnancy in women with infertility and obesity.The shorter time to pregnancy in the control group can be explained by the fact that these participants received in vitro fertilisation (IVF)/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) treatment six months earlier than the intervention group.No studies reported on male factor infertility outcomes. Due to very low-quality evidence, we are uncertain whether preconception lifestyle advice on alcohol intake a ects the number of live births and decreases the number of miscarriages in at-risk drinking women with infertility.No studies reported on adverse events. No studies reported lifestyle behavioural changes in weight, diet, vitamin or mineral supplement intake, ca eine intake, physical activity, smoking, or other substance abuse.One study reported on behavioural changes in alcohol intake but not as defined in the review methods.No studies reported on birth weight, gestational age, clinical pregnancy, time to pregnancy, quality of life, or male factor infertility outcomes. One study reported on lifestyle behavioural changes in smoking but not as defined in the review methods.No studies reported on all other outcomes. Evidence from identified studies was not su icient to justify firm conclusions on the e ect of preconception lifestyle advice.Seven studies met the inclusion criteria for this review, only three of which reported on live birth or ongoing pregnancy (Belan 2019 Mutsaerts 2016 Rossi 2013), and one provided data on live birth on request (Oostingh 2020).The predefined safety outcomes (adverse events and miscarriage) were reported in only one study (Mutsaerts 2016) .Evidence is also insu icient to address most of the secondary outcomes of the review.For example, birth weight, gestational age, quality of life, and time to pregnancy were adequately reported in only one study, and male factor infertility was not a measured outcome in any of the included studies.Although lifestyle behavioural changes a er the intervention were reported in all studies, a variety of measures and definitions were used to report these changes.Likewise, four studies reported on clinical pregnancy using a variety of definitions.Although all definitions used were in accordance with the ICMART (International Committee for Monitoring Assisted Reproduction Technology) Glossary, we were unable to synthesise these data in our meta-analysis (Zegers-Hochschild 2017).This inconsistency in reporting outcomes and the small number of studies covering all predefined outcomes contributed to our inability to synthesise results and compare and combine individual studies into a meta-analysis.Consequently, this limits the usefulness of this evidence in informing clinical practice. We aimed to assess a wide range of participants (men and women, before and during fertility treatment) and interventions (preconception lifestyle on a combination of topics or on one topic, in di erent settings, varying mode of delivery or duration) to consider clinical utility of the preconception lifestyle advice, and to identify optimal components of preconception lifestyle advice in a broad population.It may be expected that most evidence may be available for a population with specific risk factors of preconception health such as smoking, obesity, or at-risk drinking.It may also be expected that interventions started before any fertility treatment is begun may have a di erent e ect than interventions provided during fertility treatment.Given the limited number of identified studies, subgroup analyses on participant or intervention characteristics were not feasible, and inclusion of such a wide range of participants and interventions resulted in clinical heterogeneity. The paucity of RCTs performed on this topic may be explained by the possible necessity to delay fertility treatment; a er receiving preconception lifestyle advice, the couple has to undertake lifestyle changes, which may take up to several months before any e ect will be noticeable (e.g.weight loss).Once a cause of infertility has been diagnosed and there is indication for fertility treatment, advice on lifestyle behaviour changes seems an unfavourable option for both patients and clinicians.Nevertheless, our search identified nine ongoing studies, reflecting increasing interest in preconception lifestyle interventions. Infertility is a couple\\'s condition, and couples may have a correlated lifestyle, for example, in weight and diet (Best 2017). Addressing couples on lifestyle interventions may provide extra support and promote compliance and behavioural change.It may thus be expected that involving both partners in preconception lifestyle advice may have greater impact as compared to advising only the woman, to positively change preconception health.In our review, we included only one study that had invited male participants (Oostingh 2020).However, not all male partners of female participants took part in the study.This may reflect the reluctance of male partners to be involved in lifestyle behavioural changes in preparation for pregnancy.Hence, our review stresses Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews not only the need to further explore the e ect of preconception lifestyle advice in couples, but also the need to create awareness in our patients on the importance of preconception health for both partners if a healthy pregnancy is to be achieved. Based on the GRADE criteria, the quality of the evidence was low to very low. The main reasons to downgrade the evidence were serious risk of bias and serious imprecision due to the limited number of studies and hence, the limited number of patients or events.Despite the fact that all included studies investigated the e ects of preconception lifestyle advice in a population with infertility, live birth was defined as an outcome in only a minority of studies. Failure to report live birth in infertility trials is a major source of bias, as it should be the default primary outcome in such studies (Harbin Consensus Conference Workshop Group 2014).Remarkably, most studies were rated at high risk or at unclear risk of bias due to poor reporting of study methods.In some cases, study authors were not able to provide us with additional data to clarify their study methods.Obviously, all studies were at high risk of detection bias for patient-reported outcome measures because of the type of intervention and the impossibility of blinding participants to such types of interventions. We found few studies for each comparison; therefore quality of the evidence was low to very low; it is very likely that further research will have an important impact on our confidence in the e ect estimates and may change these estimates. This review was conducted according to Cochrane methods, with a pre-defined protocol to minimise potential bias.Changes were made to the review protocol before the update was undertaken, to improve the structure of the review.Changes are noted in the Di erences between protocol and review section.No changes were made as a result of the findings of included studies.We aimed to minimise reporting bias by conducting a comprehensive search for eligible studies and by being alert for duplication of data.Due to the small number of studies included in the review, we were not able to construct a funnel plot, and consequently, we were not able to examine the presence of publication bias.Reporting bias was assessed through careful assessment of included studies for failure to report obvious outcomes or for reporting them in insu icient detail.Risk of bias assessment for reporting bias was independently conducted by two review authors.We have included this level of detail in the \\'Risk of bias\\' table under Characteristics of included studies. We defined our intervention as follows: \"preconception lifestyle advice defined as counselling about weight, diet, vitamin or mineral supplement intake, alcohol intake, ca eine intake, physical activity, smoking, and/or other substance abuse.\"Many of the initially identified studies evaluated a well-defined intervention (e.g.supervised physical activity, a strict diet).Similarly, multiple studies investigated the e ects of supplements or study products.Because these interventions were not initiated as preconception lifestyle advice alone, do not reflect daily clinical practice, and do not allow for assessment of lifestyle behavioural changes, we did not include such studies in our review.Consequently, we excluded a large number of studies that may provide useful information on the topic of lifestyle interventions in people with infertility. We identified one other systematic review on the e ects of preconception lifestyle interventions on people with infertility (Lan 2017) .This paper reviewed the impact of preconception lifestyle interventions on fertility, obstetrical, foetal, anthropometric, and metabolic outcomes in a population with intent to conceive, including people with infertility.Thus, both women and men were included, but inclusion was not limited to a population with infertility.Additionally, we excluded studies solely focusing on alcohol or smoking cessation and micronutrient supplementation.Finally, interventions were not restricted to preconception lifestyle advice but included any modifications aiming to optimise nutritional and/or physical activity status, such as weight management, dietary changes, exercise regimens, and psychological support. We searched the literature published up to January 2017 and identified eight studies, which were primarily performed among women with infertility who were overweight or obese.Only one of these studies was included in our review, as the other studies provided strict weight loss interventions or were not conducted in people with infertility (Mutsaerts 2016).Review authors concluded that lifestyle interventions showed benefits for weight loss and BMI reduction in overweight and obese women.Study authors did not use the GRADE system to determine the quality of the evidence, and so we are unable to confirm their findings.Similar to our review, these review authors highlighted the need for further research exploring optimal components of preconception lifestyle interventions in the broader population. In the first edition of this Cochrane systematic review, the need for further research into this subject was highlighted, as no available RCTs had assessed the e ects of preconception advice on the chance of live birth or other fertility outcomes in people with diagnosed infertility (Anderson 2010) .Although the importance of providing preconception lifestyle advice is more widely acknowledged at this time (ESHRE guideline 2015 Homan 2018), we identified only six additional studies and nine ongoing studies.Consequently, we were able to add only evidence of low to very low quality to the conclusions of the first edition of this review. Low-quality evidence suggests that preconception lifestyle advice on a combination of topics may result in little to no di erence in the number of live births nor in the number of women with adequate use of folic acid supplement, abstaining from alcohol, or not smoking.Evidence was insu icient to permit a conclusion on the e ects and safety of preconception lifestyle advice on adverse events, miscarriage, birth weight, gestational age, clinical pregnancy, quality of life, or male factor infertility outcomes, as no identified studies looked at these outcomes or the studies were of very low quality.Delaying the start of fertility treatment to give preconception lifestyle advice on weight may slightly reduce BMI and increase time to pregnancy among women with infertility and obesity, but the evidence is of low quality.We are uncertain whether Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews preconception lifestyle advice a ects other lifestyle behavioural changes, as no identified studies looked at these outcomes or the studies were of very low quality. This review does not provide clear guidance for clinical practice on preconception lifestyle advice.However it highlights the lack of evidence on this topic, despite recommendations by international guidelines to provide counselling to all couples with infertility.Our findings also reveal the absence of male participation in the vast majority of studies addressing this topic. In conclusion, our review highlights the need for high-quality RCTs investigating e ects of preconception lifestyle advice on a combination of topics and assessing relevant e ectiveness and safety outcomes for men and women with infertility. Based on the findings of the current review, we propose that future research should include well-designed, adequately powered RCTs with meticulous description of study methods.Future research in this area should explore the e ects of preconception lifestyle not only of women with infertility but also of their male partners.Such studies will allow further examination of the interaction within couples.In addition, studies should focus on specific subgroups such as women with infertility and obesity and should also address a broader population with infertility.In most modern countries, unhealthy lifestyle is on the rise; therefore it may be recommended to investigate the beneficial e ects of preconception lifestyle counselling among all couples planning to conceive.The e ects of various intervention characteristics including di erent topics on lifestyle advice, duration, setting, behaviour change techniques used, and format of interventions should be explored in future research.Studies should report in detail on these intervention characteristics.Besides the content of advice provided, the mode of delivery and the timing of advice should be considered.This will enable researchers to identify optimal components of preconception lifestyle interventions.In the comparison arm, minimal treatment or attention control that mimics the amount of attention received by the intervention group but is thought not to have a specific e ect should be considered. Of key importance is future assessment of relevant e ectiveness and safety outcomes.Future research should record core outcome measures for infertility trials and report accordingly (Du y 2020a Du y 2020b).Ideally, core outcome measures on reported lifestyle behavioural changes should be specified and should be reported consistently.Data can thus be combined and synthesised to generate solid evidence to inform clinical practice.

We found six randomised controlled trials comparing a gradient, swim-up or wash technique, in a total of 485 couples undergoing IUI.The evidence is current to March 2019. We are uncertain whether there is a di erence in pregnancy outcomes between the three sperm preparation techniques for subfertile couples undergoing IUI.No studies reported on live birth rates. Considering the quality of evidence (very low), we are uncertain whether there was a di erence between clinical pregnancy rates (CPR) for swim-up versus a gradient technique.The results suggest that if the chance of pregnancy a er the use of a gradient technique is assumed to be 24%, the chance of pregnancy a er using the swim-up technique is between 14% and 30%.We are uncertain whether there was a Considering the quality of evidence (very low), we are uncertain whether there is a di erence in clinical pregnancy rates a er a gradient versus wash and centrifugation technique.The results suggest that if the chance of pregnancy a er the use of a wash technique is assumed to be 13%, the chance of pregnancy a er using the gradient technique is between 8% and 46%.Considering the quality of evidence, we are uncertain whether there was a di erence between multiple pregnancy rates per couple between the treatment groups.Considering the quality of evidence, we are also uncertain whether there was a di erence between miscarriage rates per couple between the treatment groups.No studies reported on ongoing pregnancy rate, ectopic pregnancy rate, fetal abnormalities or infection rate. The quality of the evidence was very low.The main limitations were (unclear) risk of bias, signs of imprecision (small number of studies/ participants included) and inconsistency in results among studies. There were no events in either group *The basis for the assumed risk (e.g. the median control group risk across studies) is provided in footnotes.The corresponding risk (and its 95% CI) is based on the assumed risk in the comparison group and the relative effect of the intervention (and its 95% CI). Relative effect (95% CI) Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews The success of the treatment of subfertile couples has made substantial progress over the last two decades.Subfertile couples are defined as couples who have tried unsuccessfully to conceive for at least one year despite regular and unprotected sexual intercourse (Evers 2002) .Subfertility is a common problem, a ecting up to 15% of couples (Evers 2002; Templeton 1990 ). Demand for infertility treatment is on the rise as increasing numbers of women delay having children till an age when natural female fertility is in decline and there is a raised chance of exposure to sexually transmitted diseases and continually falling sperm counts (Delhanty 2001; Niederberger 2018; Swan 1999) , although worldwide the percentage of women seeking treatment has not significantly changed over the last two decades (Mascarenhas 2012) .According to a number of high-quality studies, intrauterine insemination (IUI) should be the first choice treatment in case of unexplained and moderate male factor subfertility and an unfavourable prognosis for natural conception (Farquhar 2018; Ombelet 2017) . With the emergence of in vitro fertilization (IVF) with uterine transfer of embryos (IVF-ET), semen preparation techniques were developed to separate motile sperm that are morphologically normal (normal appearance) from seminal plasma (the fluid portion of the semen in which the spermatozoa are suspended) and foreign material.It is known that white blood cells, bacteria and dead spermatozoa produce oxygen radicals that negatively influence the ability of normal spermatozoa to fertilize the egg (Aitken 1994; De Jonge 2002; Parinaud 1997) .Reactive oxygen species (ROS) cause peroxidative damage and loss of sperm function, as well as DNA damage in both the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes (WHO 2010).A randomised controlled trial (RCT) of prepared sperm compared to unprepared first split ejaculates showed that semen preparation significantly increased the probability of conception a er IUI in a group of couples with male subfertility (Goldenberg 1992) .Furthermore, in IUI the use of fresh unprepared semen has been reported to cause uterine cramps and may induce pelvic inflammatory disease, endometritis, cervicitis or vaginitis, as well as an increased likelihood of miscarriage, premature delivery or a malformed fetus (Wang 1991; Yan 1998) . Some research has suggested an association between the probability of conception a er IUI and the absolute number of motile sperm that are inseminated.Some retrospective studies have defined a threshold level beyond which pregnancy rates reached a plateau (Berg 1997; Huang 1996a; Khalil 2001; Madbouly 2017) .However, the threshold levels found in these studies di ered substantially from one to five million motile sperm, which makes these results less useful in practice.One prospective controlled trial demonstrated links between total sperm motility and the probability of conception a er IUI ( Van Voorhis 2001) . In couples with subfertility, the yield of as many motile, morphologically normal spermatozoa as possible is important as it influences treatment choices and therefore outcomes.A high yield can lead to a preference for IUI or IVF, whereas a lower yield could result in a preference for intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).ICSI is an IVF procedure in which a single sperm is injected directly into an egg, a procedure that is most commonly used to overcome severe male infertility problems.The treatment outcome a er ICSI is not related to the number of available motile sperm. Many sperm preparation procedures are available, but there are three main groups of methods. Firstly, spermatozoa may be selected on their ability to swim, known as the \\'swim-up technique\\'.This technique is performed by layering culture medium over the liquefied semen.Motile spermatozoa swim up into the culture.The upper part of the layered medium is then carefully removed for further use. The second method of selecting spermatozoa is by the use of density gradients.The semen sample is pipetted on top of the density column, which is then centrifuged.Density gradient centrifugation separates spermatozoa according to their density.This way you can select the motile, morphologically normal spermatozoa in the solution with the highest concentration of gradient, which is aspirated for further use (WHO 1999) .Sperm preparation with the use of density gradient centrifugation has been a standard technique in assisted reproductive techniques.Fresh semen samples have been centrifuged on Percoll gradients in the 40% to 90% range with good recovery (Byrd 1996) .In late 1996, Percoll was removed from clinical human use.This product was replaced by silica stabilized with covalently bound hydrophilic silane, marketed under several commercial names. The third method is the conventional wash method in combination with centrifugation, previously only used for diagnostic procedures.The semen sample is diluted with a medium and centrifuged.Subsequently, the pellet (the bottom part a er centrifugation) is resuspended in a small amount of medium and incubated until the time of insemination. Apart from a simple wash technique, the swim-up technique is the oldest and most commonly used sperm preparation method. It is still used largely in IUI and IVF laboratories around the world.Density gradient techniques are easier to standardize than the swim-up technique and the results are more consistent.Usually, the choice of sperm preparation technique is dictated by the nature of the semen sample.Swim-up technique is o en used when semen samples are considered to be largely normal, whereas density gradient techniques can be preferred in male factor infertility because of the greater total number of motile spermatozoa recovered (Henkel 2003; WHO 2010) . The aim of semen preparation is to separate the normal sperm from the debris of the ejaculate and, in the case of IUI, to yield as many normal motile spermatozoa as possible.The number of motile sperm a er preparation in relation to the total number of motile sperm before preparation is expressed as the recovery rate.Preparation techniques that have higher recovery rates are considered superior for IUI.Sperm preparation techniques may also influence DNA fragmentation.A prospective randomised study was conducted in subfertile patients (unexplained and male factor infertility) to compare basal and post-procedure DNA fragmentation rates in swim-up and gradient techniques.Swimup method significantly reduces sperm DNA fragmentation rates (Oguz 2018) .Current evidence supports the association between Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews high sperm DNA fragmentation and poor reproductive outcomes for natural conception and intrauterine insemination (Cho 2017) . Although spermatozoa recovery rates might be interesting when you compare di erent semen preparation techniques, clinicians and prospective parents regard live birth rate as the most important outcome.One type of semen preparation technique might be superior to another in relation to clinical outcome a er IUI. To compare the e ectiveness of three di erent semen preparation techniques (gradient; swim-up; wash and centrifugation) on clinical outcomes (live birth rate, clinical pregnancy rate) in subfertile couples undergoing IUI. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in this review.We assessed the method of randomisation to determine whether each study was truly randomised.We only included studies with a crossover design in the meta-analysis if the first cycle was randomised and first cycle data were available (prior to crossing-over).We did not include split-sample studies since by design they cannot compare clinical outcomes. We defined subfertility as couples who have tried unsuccessfully to conceive for at least one year, despite regular and unprotected sexual intercourse (Evers 2002) .We placed no restriction on causes of subfertility.We defined unexplained subfertility as infertility for at least one year without any abnormality found at routine fertility check-up (normal results in semen analyses, luteal phase assessment, tubal patency, immunological testing and investigations into uterine anomalies).We did not include normal fertile participants or healthy volunteers. If essential information about the participants was lacking, we sought more information from the authors. Any included study must have made a comparison of the following, in pairs or in a combination of all three techniques: • A gradient technique We searched for all published and unpublished RCTs comparing clinical outcomes a er a gradient technique, swim-up technique or wash and centrifuge, without language restriction and in consultation with the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group (CGF) Information Specialist, Marian Showell. We searched the following electronic databases for relevant trials. We also handsearched the citation lists of relevant publications, review articles, European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) and American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) abstract books.We conducted a simple search in PubMed and Google in order to identify any trials not yet indexed in the major databases.We searched abstracts of scientific meetings and included studies.We also searched the trial register www.ClinicalTrials.gov(a service of the US National Institutes of Health) for ongoing and registered trials (Appendix 6).In addition we had personal communication with experts and authors in the field. A er an initial screen of titles and abstracts retrieved by the search, conducted by two authors (Boomsma and Cohlen), we retrieved the full texts of all potentially eligible studies.Two review authors (Boomsma and Cohlen) independently examined these full-text articles for compliance with the inclusion criteria and selected eligible studies.We corresponded with study investigators as required, to clarify study eligibility.We resolved disagreement through discussion or, if required, in consultation with the third author until we reached consensus.If any reports had required translation, we would have described the process used for data collection.We have documented the selection process with a PRISMA flow chart (Figure 1 ). Two review authors independently extracted data from eligible studies using a data extraction form designed and pilot-tested by the authors.We resolved any disagreements by discussion.Data extracted included study characteristics and outcome data (see data extraction form for details, Appendix 7) .We corresponded with study investigators for further data on methods, results or both, as required.Data are o en presented in a non-standardised format: we included studies irrespective of whether outcomes are reported in a \\'usable\\' way.In multi-arm studies, we excluded data from arms that do not meet eligibility criteria. Two review authors independently assessed the included studies for risk of bias using the Cochrane \\'Risk of bias\\' assessment tool (Higgins 2011) to assess the following. • Selection bias (random sequence generation and allocation concealment) • Performance bias (blinding of participants and personnel) • Detection bias (blinding of outcome assessment; the primary outcome \\'live birth rate/ongoing pregnancy rate\\' was not, however, susceptible to this kind of bias) • Attrition bias (describing the completeness of outcome data) • Reporting bias (selective reporting, such as failure to report outcomes/publication bias) • Other bias. We assigned judgements as recommended in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, Section 8.5.There were no disagreements.We summarised results in the \\'Risk of bias\\' tables for all included studies, and incorporated them into our interpretation of review findings. For dichotomous data (e.g.clinical pregnancy rates), we used the numbers of events in the control and intervention groups of each study to calculate odds ratio (OR).We presented 95% confidence intervals for all outcomes.Should data to calculate ORs not have been available, we would have utilised the most detailed numerical data available that may facilitate similar analyses of included studies (e.g.test statistics, P values).We assessed whether the estimates calculated in the review for individual studies were compatible in each case with the estimates reported in the study publications. Results from included studies that we excluded from the metaanalysis due to a cross-over design are described in additional tables (Table 1, Table 2 ).The primary analyses are data per couple randomised; only miscarriage rates per pregnancy were mentioned in the review text.We have only included first-phase data from cross-over trials and we contacted authors when needed. For included studies, we have noted levels of attrition in the Characteristics of included studies tables.We analysed the data on an intention-to-treat basis as far as possible. We examined heterogeneity between the results of di erent studies by inspecting the scatter in the data points and the overlap in their confidence intervals, and more formally by checking the results of the Chi tests.We took an I statistic greater than 50% to indicate substantial statistical heterogeneity (Higgins 2011) .Clinical heterogeneity in subfertility cannot be avoided because most centres use their own materials and methods, which can di er in a number of ways.When trials met the inclusion criteria and they had performed the same intervention, we considered it appropriate to pool their results. In view of the di iculty of detecting and correcting for publication bias and other reporting biases, we aimed to minimise their potential impact by ensuring a comprehensive search for eligible studies and by being alert for duplication of data.If there had been 10 or more studies in an analysis, we would have used a funnel plot to explore the possibility of small-study e ects (a tendency for estimates of the intervention e ect to be more beneficial in smaller studies). We combined the data using a fixed-e ect model (underlying e ect size assumed to be the same for all trials in the analysis) in the following comparisons. We performed statistical analysis using Review Manager 5 (Review Manager 2014).We considered clinical pregnancy and live birth rates to be positive consequences of treatment; we therefore considered a higher proportion achieving these outcomes to be a benefit.The outcomes of adverse e ects (multiple pregnancy, miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, fetal abnormalities and infections) are negative consequences of treatment and therefore we considered higher numbers to be detrimental.This needs to be taken into consideration when viewing the summary graphs. A priori, it was planned to perform a subgroup analysis to look at the possible contribution of di erences in the indication of subfertility (male factor versus other) and type and method of the semen preparation technique.It was planned to perform these analyses if there were more than five trials in each group. A priori, we planned to perform a sensitivity analysis to determine whether the conclusions are robust to arbitrary decisions made regarding the eligibility and analysis and to look at the possible contribution of di erences in methodological quality of the trials.We would have performed sensitivity analyses by excluding those studies with a high risk of bias.We planned to perform these analyses if there were more than five trials in each group. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. We prepared a \\'Summary of findings\\' table using GRADEpro and Cochrane methods.This table evaluates the overall quality of the body of evidence for the main review outcomes (clinical pregnancy rate, ongoing pregnancy rate, multiple pregnancy rate, and miscarriage rate) for the main review comparisons (swim-up versus gradient technique, swim-up versus wash technique, and gradient versus wash technique).Two review authors (Boomsma and Farquhar) assessed the quality of the evidence independently by using GRADE criteria: risk of bias; consistency of e ect; imprecision; indirectness; and publication bias. Sixty-one studies (39 studies a er the initial search and 22 studies a er the update) were potentially eligible and we retrieved them in full text.Seven studies met our inclusion criteria (of which we included six studies in the meta-analysis).We excluded 54 studies.See study tables: Characteristics of included studies, and Characteristics of excluded studies.A PRISMA flow chart of the results of the initial and updated search is included (Figure 1 ). We included six randomised controlled trials in the meta-analysis (Dodson 1998; Grigoriou 2005; Karamahmutoglu 2014; Posada 2005; Soliman 2005; Xu 2000) .We included one of the studies in the meta-analysis a er contact with the authors of the study (Dodson 1998) .This study had a cross-over design but the authors were able to provide initial cycle data, prior to the cross-over.Carrell 1998 was not able to provide data from the initial treatment cycle, and therefore we included this study in the review but excluded it from the meta-analysis.The characteristics and results of these crossover trials are summarized in Table 1 and Table 2. Only Karamahmutoglu 2014 and Dodson 1998 performed a power analysis; only Karamahmutoglu 2014 performed it prospectively.Dodson 1998 reported that 700 cycles would have been needed in each treatment arm (power 80%) and they included 153 cycles in total.Karamahmutoglu 2014 reported 280 patients were required (140 in each treatment arm), 223 couples were included in total.Both studies do not describe the reasons for not including the number of patients needed for adequate statistical power. The studies included 485 subfertile couples undergoing IUI with subfertility for at least one year. Dodson 1998 , Karamahmutoglu 2014 , Posada 2005 and Soliman 2005 included women with a variety of causes of infertility.Male factor infertility was excluded by Carrell 1998.Grigoriou 2005 included couples with unexplained infertility.The cause of subfertility in Xu 2000 was male factor infertility only (all semen samples were oligoasthenoteratospermic). Treatment groups were similar at baseline in Dodson 1998 , Karamahmutoglu 2014 , Posada 2005 .Since Grigoriou 2005 and Xu 2000 lacked details about important prognostic indicators concerning the participants (women\\'s age, duration of infertility), it was unclear whether treatment groups were similar at baseline regarding these indicators.Women\\'s age is an important factor in predicting the success of reproductive treatment (Campana 1996) .In Dodson 1998 we were able to extract information about the participants from the raw data supplied by the authors.Soliman 2005, an abstract, did report women\\'s age (32.4 and 34.5 years for the gradient and wash technique respectively). The studies were performed in di erent countries: Canada No trials reported the primary outcome \\'live birth\\'.All included studies reported the primary outcome \\'clinical pregnancy rate per couple\\'.However, Xu 2000 and Soliman 2005 only reported pregnancy rates without a definition.Posada 2005 reported clinical pregnancy rates, also without definition.Dodson 1998, Grigoriou 2005 and Karamahmutoglu 2014 defined clinical pregnancy rate by the presence of a gestational sac on ultrasound scan. Karamahmutoglu 2014 reported ongoing pregnancy rates defined as a viable fetus detected a er 12 weeks of pregnancy. A er receiving raw data from Dodson 1998 we were also able to calculate the miscarriage rate and multiple pregnancy rate per couple (first cycle).Karamahmutoglu 2014 and Posada 2005 also reported the miscarriage rate per couple.No other adverse e ects were described by the studies. Fi y-four studies failed to meet the inclusion criteria for reasons outlined in the table Characteristics of excluded studies.Exclusions, for one or more reasons, were as follows. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. We excluded 32 studies as they did not perform a comparison of interest (Abed 2015; Almagor 1993; Aribarg 1995; Bajamonte 1994; Baka 2009; Berteli 2017; Bhakta 2010; Chan 1992; Fazaeli 2018; Fleming 2008; Gentis 2012; Heidari 2016; Huang 1996b; Inaudi 2002; Jalilian 2016; Karlström 1991; Kücük 2008; Mathieu 1988; Menge 1992; Monqaut 2011; Ozturk 2008; Paul 2004; Ragni 1998; Romany 2017; Roth 2018; Siam 2012; Su 1993; Tomari 2017; Tsai 2004; Urry 1988; Zarmakoupis-Zavos 1998; Zavos 1992) .Menge 1992, a conference abstract, was not able to provide separate data from the swim-up and Percoll group and, a er contact with the authors, this allocation seemed to us to be non-randomised.Urry and colleagues did not provide separate data in their article about the comparison between the swim-up and wash preparation in the \\'husband artificial insemination group\\' (Urry 1988).We did not succeed in contacting the authors to see if separate data were available. We excluded 17 studies for not using IUI as an assisted reproduction technique (Bajamonte 1994; Chan 1992; Cimino 1990; Guerin 1989; Hammadeh 2001; Heidari 2016; Jaroudi 1993; Leonetti 1995; Levay 1995; Mathieu 1988; Ord 1990; Ricci 2009; Sapienza 1993; Tanphaichitr 1988; Tomari 2017; Van Der Zwalmen 1991; Zech 1993) . We excluded 30 studies for failing to use a randomised design (Almagor 1993; Bajamonte 1994; Berteli 2017; Caccamo 1995; Chan 1992; Cimino 1990; Depypere 1995; Fleming 2008; Guerin 1989; Hammadeh 2001; Heidari 2016; Huang 1996b; Leonetti 1995; Levay 1995; Mathieu 1988; Menge 1992; Morshedi 2003; Oguz 2018; Ohashi 1992; Ord 1990; Remohi 1989; Ren 2004; Ricci 2009; Roth 2018; Su 1993; Tanphaichitr 1988; Tomari 2017; Urry 1988; Van Der Zwalmen 1991; Werlin 1992) .Four studies were quasi-randomised (Bajamonte 1994; Morshedi 2003; Tomari 2017; Werlin 1992) ; and Van Der Zwalmen 1991 and Remohi 1989 failed to describe the design.Two studies were excluded a er contact with the authors (Butt 2016; Oguz 2018) .Butt 2016 appeared to be a prospective observational study.The method of sperm preparation (density gradient versus swim-up) was dependent on sperm parameters rather than randomised.Oguz 2018 compared a swim-up and gradient technique on sperm DNA fragmentation status of semen samples from patients undergoing IUI.Sperm DNA fragmentation rates were evaluated in two portions of each sample of semen that was prepared with either swim-up or gradient techniques.A erwards, patients were randomised to swim-up versus gradient technique, and one half of the semen sample was used for IUI.However, clinical data in relation to sperm preparation technique was not available. The risk of bias of the studies is summarised in Figure 2  We rated two studies at low risk of selection bias related to sequence generation, as they used computer randomisation (Dodson 1998; Karamahmutoglu 2014) .We also rated Grigoriou 2005 at low risk of selection bias since they randomised their patients by a permuted block design from a table with random numbers.Four studies did not describe the method used and we rated them at unclear risk of this bias (Carrell 1998; Posada 2005; Soliman 2005; Xu 2000) .We did not succeed in contacting the authors. We rated two studies at low risk of selection bias regarding allocation concealment, as allocation was concealed by keeping the random numbers sequence at the laboratory in a separate location (Dodson 1998; Karamahmutoglu 2014) .Four studies failed to describe methods of allocation concealment and we rated these at unclear risk of bias for this domain (Carrell 1998; Posada 2005; Soliman 2005; Xu 2000) .We did not succeed in contacting the authors.We rated one study at high risk of selection bias since allocation was not concealed (Grigoriou 2005). In Karamahmutoglu 2014 the patients and the clinicians were blinded from knowledge of which sperm preparation technique was used by keeping the method of sperm preparation restricted to the laboratory sta .In Dodson 1998 study participants were blinded (information provided by the authors), but personnel were not blinded from knowledge of which intervention a participant received.Grigoriou 2005, Posada 2005, Soliman 2005 and Xu 2000 did not report blinding.We considered all studies to be at a high risk of performance bias, since the laboratory sta can easily perform better or worse with either technique according to subjective and subconscious prejudice. In Karamahmutoglu 2014 outcome assessors were blinded from knowledge of which intervention a participant received; intended blinding was e ective.Laboratory sta were not involved in outcome assessment.Overall, therefore, a low risk of detection bias. We consider risk of detection bias for all other studies (due to knowledge of the allocated interventions by outcome assessors) to be unclear, since the primary review outcomes are not susceptible to bias (clinical pregnancy/live birth rate). Dodson 1998 reported four dropouts who achieved a treatmentindependent pregnancy during study enrolment; no intention-totreat analysis was done.They do not report further dropouts (high risk of attrition bias).Grigoriou 2005 reported two dropouts in the swim-up study group; no reason was reported.An intention-totreat analysis was performed (by imputation of no event) (low risk of attrition bias).The number of cancelled cycles was not stated.Five studies did not report dropouts or loss to follow-up and we judged them to be at unclear risk of attrition bias (Carrell 1998; Karamahmutoglu 2014; Posada 2005; Soliman 2005; Xu 2000) . We identified no studies at high risk for selective reporting.No studies reported live birth as an outcome; this primary outcome is o en not reported in fertility studies, however, because of the need for long follow-up rather than selective reporting bias.None of the studies failed to report outcomes that they planned to in their Methods section.However, data on adverse events were available for only two of the studies (Dodson 1998; Posada 2005) .We did not classify the studies which did not report adverse events as at high risk of selective reporting in this review since adverse events are not expected as a result of di erent semen preparation techniques and the impact of failure to report them is unclear. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. It was not useful to use a funnel plot to assess for publication bias, since at most four studies were pooled in any meta-analysis. We identified use of inappropriate cross-over design as a source of potential bias in two studies (Carrell 1998; Dodson 1998) .The risk of other biases was unclear in two studies (Soliman 2005; Xu 2000), one of which was an abstract (Soliman 2005), as they did not describe their methods in detail.In Xu 2000 it was unclear whether treatment groups were similar at baseline.In addition, the definition of pregnancy was unclear in Posada 2005, Xu 2000 and Soliman 2005, and we assumed it to be a risk of bias.Although Posada 2005 did report clinical pregnancy rates, rather than pregnancy rates.

Considering the quality of evidence, we are uncertain whether there was a di erence between CPR for swim-up versus a gradient technique (PR 22% versus 24% respectively; odds ratio (OR) 0.83, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.35; I = 71%; 4 RCTs, 370 participants; very lowquality evidence).The results suggest that if the chance of clinical pregnancy a er the use of a gradient technique is assumed to be 24%, the chance of clinical pregnancy a er using the swim-up technique is between 14% and 30%.See Figure 4 . There were no available data from Dodson 1998, Posada 2005 and Xu 2000.The ongoing pregnancy rate per couple was 11% a er swim-up technique versus 23% a er gradient technique (Karamahmutoglu 2014).Although there was a significantly higher ongoing pregnancy rate a er gradient versus swim-up technique, we are uncertain whether there was a real di erence between ongoing pregnancy rates per couple considering the quality of evidence (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.82; heterogeneity not applicable; 1 RCT, 223 participants; very low-quality evidence). There were no available data from Karamahmutoglu 2014, Posada 2005 and Xu 2000.No multiple pregnancies were observed by Dodson 1998.

No studies reported on this outcome. No studies reported on this outcome. No studies reported on this outcome. Overall there was no clear evidence which semen preparation technique was superior.No studies provided information on laboratory time and costs per preparation technique.Summaries of our findings are provided in the Summary of findings for the main comparison, Summary of findings 2, and Summary of findings 3. We examined heterogeneity between the results of the di erent studies by inspecting the scatter in the data points and the overlap in their confidence intervals, and more formally by checking the results of the Chi tests.We took an I measurement greater than 50% as an indicator of substantial statistical heterogeneity.Considering the results of the meta-analysis, there was a large overlap in confidence intervals.There was, however, a large di erence in the direction of e ect.Meta-analysis of the pregnancy results a er swim-up technique versus gradient technique (I = 71%), and swim-up versus wash technique (I = 55%) and wash technique versus gradient technique (I = 52%) showed indication of substantial heterogeneity.This may partly be explained by heterogeneity in the sperm preparation procedures among the di erent trials, which are not standardised.Care must be taken in the interpretation of the Chi test in these meta-analyses though, since it has low power when studies have small sample sizes and are few in number.We could perform no sensitivity analyses to explore the heterogeneity. The aim of this review was to compare the e ectiveness of three di erent semen preparation techniques (gradient; swim-up; wash and centrifugation) on clinical outcomes (live birth rate; clinical pregnancy rate) in subfertile couples undergoing IUI. The first conclusion that can be drawn from this systematic review is that large, high-quality randomised controlled trials comparing the e ectiveness of a gradient, swim-up or wash and centrifugation technique, alone or in combination, are lacking.No studies reported on live birth rates.We identified only seven RCTs which compared a gradient technique versus a swim-up technique or a wash technique for IUI (Carrell 1998; Dodson 1998; Grigoriou 2005; Karamahmutoglu 2014; Posada 2005; Soliman 2005; Xu 2000) .We identified one cross-over RCT, which we excluded from the meta-analysis but included in the review (Carrell 1998), since we could not extract data prior to crossing over. In conclusion, we are uncertain whether there is a di erence in pregnancy outcomes between the three sperm preparation techniques for subfertile couples undergoing IUI.The quality of evidence was very low.The main limitations were (unclear) risk of bias (unclear reporting), signs of imprecision and inconsistency in results among studies and the lack of power. The increasing availability of therapeutic choices resulting from advances in subfertility research poses a problem in trying to determine whether these options are equally e ective in clinical care.In 2010 the World Health Organization (WHO) published a WHO laboratory manual for the examination and processing of Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews human semen (WHO 2010).The manual describes the choices for sperm preparation, which is dictated by the nature of the semen sample (Canale 1994) .For example, the direct swim-up technique is o en used when the semen sample is considered to be largely normal; whereas in cases of severe oligozoospermia, teratospermia or asthenospermia, density gradients are usually preferred because of the greater total number of motile spermatozoa recovered.Wash and centrifugation is not widely used, and is only thought to be suitable for normospermic specimens (WHO 2010).We have not been able to perform subgroup analyses to investigate this research question.The WHO laboratory manual also advises that each laboratory should determine a er rigorous pre-clinical testing the optimal centrifugal force and centrifugation time necessary to increase the chance of recovering the maximum number of spermatozoa (WHO 2010). We included six studies in the meta-analysis, of which only one study was less than 10 years old.The relevance of these older studies in current laboratory practice can be questioned.However, in general, laboratory procedures of sperm preparation have not significantly changed in the last two decades.Media used have been more standardised, though.A simple two-step discontinuous density-gradient preparation method is most widely applied.A number of commercial products are available for making density gradients suitable for semen processing (WHO 2010).Percoll was previously used in ART; since 1996, however, it has only been used for research purposes due to concerns about its safety.Xu 2000 and Dodson 1998 both used Percoll gradient.Research demonstrated, however, that the new products appear to be as e ective as Percoll for the recovery of good, progressively motile sperm (Centola 1998) . The reason for the absence of current studies is unknown; and we could identify none ongoing in trial registers either.There is a wide practice variation of used methods and outcomes in IUI in fertility laboratories (Lemmens 2018) .Although there is a lack of evidence for their e icacy, many laboratories seem to prefer density gradient techniques which are easier to use and standardize than the swimup technique (WHO 2010).The lack of new studies may also be the result of the ongoing debate about the value of IUI (Lemmens 2017 ).The British National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline for infertility treatment (NICE 2013) strongly reduced the indications for IUI with IVF/ICSI as a first line treatment in the majority of cases. The studies we identified were not su icient to address the objectives of this review, due to statistical heterogeneity among the studies and methodological limitations. Only randomised controlled trials were included in this metaanalysis.The quality of the evidence was very low.The main limitations in the evidence were unclear risk of bias, signs of inconsistency and (very) serious imprecision.Only two of the seven included studies used and described an adequate method of allocation concealment.In addition to the main limitations, there was a lack of blinding in most studies and high risk of performance bias in all studies.None of the studies reported live birth, which is the outcome most relevant to subfertile couples; and data on adverse events were available for only three of the studies. In addition, the number of studies was low.One study dominated the results (Karamahmutoglu 2014).However, even this study with the largest study population seriously lacked power.Many fertility trials lack power.A prospective power calculation should always be performed, although the calculated sample size in most cases will be prohibitively large.Accruing this number of participants would require several years or a multi-centre design to complete the trial.In both cases, this would increase clinical heterogeneity (Daya 2001) , but might also ensure that studies more closely resemble the heterogeneity of daily practice.Only one of the trials performed an intention-to-treat analysis.The performance of this analysis minimizes an exclusion bias.A strategy to minimize this bias is to conduct the randomisation as late as possible in the study design; the dictum of \\'select subjects early but randomise late\\' is particularly relevant in subfertility research (Daya 2001) . We assume the risk of bias in review design to be minimal; it was predefined and objective.We assume the bias in locating studies to be minimal, since the search was not limited to language or timeframe, and was conducted in multiple literature sources.We minimised the risk of bias in selecting studies by using two independent reviewers throughout the screening and data collection process, which reduces reviewer bias.The quality of the studies was assessed by two independent reviewers according to GRADE criteria.The risk of bias in synthesising studies is also assumed to be low.There was no selective outcome reporting.We published the study protocol in advance to promote transparency. The results of this review are in agreement with other evidence from studies or reviews.Many studies on the e icacy of sperm preparation techniques focus on sperm recovery rates.The direct swim-up technique generally recovers a lower number of motile sperm compared to density gradient techniques (Butt 2016; Ng 1992; WHO 2010).This outcome is not relevant to subfertile couples, however, and may not reflect clinical outcome.Firstly, the sperm preparation technique aims not only to recover a high number of morphologically normal and motile sperm, but also to eliminate any factors detrimental to fertilization and prostaglandins, and to perform sperm capacitation.Dodson 1998 and Butt 2016 showed that potential critical di erences in sperm isolation and recovery for IUI yield no benefit in cycle fecundity.This may be due to all methods surpassing a low threshold number of motile sperm for conception, or all methods recover a subset of sperm capable of achieving fertilization with no benefit of additional sperm (Dodson 1998) . The very low quality of the available evidence means we cannot be certain about the relative e ectiveness of the di erent semen preparation techniques: swim-up versus gradient versus wash and centrifugation technique.No studies reported on live birth rates.We are uncertain whether there is a di erence in clinical pregnancy rates, ongoing pregnancy rates, multiple pregnancy rates or miscarriage rates per couple between the three sperm preparation techniques.Further randomised trials are warranted that report live birth data.This meta-analysis was restricted to three types of sperm preparation but other techniques are available. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. More research needs to be performed on this topic as firm conclusions cannot be drawn from the literature available.In addition to large RCTs, the results from thorough phase II research with semen parameters as an outcome would have substantial meaning for optimising the techniques.These type of studies are suitable for \\'within participant\\' comparisons (such as Ricci 2009) . It may be interesting to combine a split sample study on semen parameters at initial semen analysis (at fertility check-up) and subsequently randomise semen preparation techniques (in the treatment cycle) to investigate whether the type of preparation needs to be individualized according to semen parameters a er di erent preparation techniques. Studies should report clinically relevant outcomes, such as ongoing pregnancy or preferably live birth rate per woman, rather than per cycle.Yet most research in the fertility field focuses on fertilisation rates, recovery rates and embryo development.Many fertility trials lack adequate reporting of methodology.The methods of randomisation and allocation concealment should be reported (Vail 2003) .Adherence to the recommendations in the guideline for reporting clinical trials (CONSORT) would create a massive improvement.Because of a large range of factors contributing to the outcome in fertility research, we recommend a clear definition of the population, inclusion and exclusion criteria and a comparison of these factors in the treatment groups.In addition, the methodology of semen preparation needs to be standardised in order to allow appropriate comparison.

Glucocorticoids compared to no glucocorticoids or placebo for assisted reproductive technology cycles Glucocorticoids compared to no glucocorticoids or placebo for assisted reproductive technology cycles Patient or population: women receiving assisted reproductive technology cycles Setting: IVF clinics Intervention: glucocorticoids\\nBody Text: The use of peri-implantation glucocorticoids has been advocated to improve embryo implantation during assistive reproductive technology (ART) cycles such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).It has been proposed that glucocorticoids may improve the intrauterine environment by acting as immunomodulators to reduce the uterine natural killer (NK) cell count and activity, normalising the cytokine expression profile in the endometrium and by suppression of endometrial inflammation. To evaluate the e ectiveness and safety of glucocorticoids versus no glucocorticoids administered around the time of anticipated implantation in women undergoing IVF or ICSI. We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility (CGF) Group specialised register, CENTRAL (now also containing output from two trial registers and CINAHL), MEDLINE and Embase, on 20 December 2021, together with reference checking, contact with experts in the field and relevant conference proceedings to identify additional studies.This review is an update of the review first published in 2007 and last updated in 2012. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the e icacy of supplementary systemic administration of glucocorticoids in the periimplantation period with a placebo or no glucocorticoids in subfertile women undergoing IVF or ICSI were included. We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane.The primary review outcomes were live birth rate and multiple pregnancy. We included 16 RCTs (2232 couples analysed).We are uncertain whether glucocorticoids improved live birth rates (odds ratio (OR) 1.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69 to 2.71; 2 RCTs, n = 366; I 2 = 7%; very low-certainty evidence).This suggests that if the chance of live birth following no glucocorticoids/placebo is assumed to be 9%, the chance following glucocorticoids would be between 6% and 21%.We are also uncertain whether there was a di erence between peri-implantation glucocorticoids on multiple pregnancy rates per couple (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.33 to 2.20; 4 RCTs, n = 504; I 2 = 53%; very low-certainty evidence).The I 2 of 53% may represent moderate statistical heterogeneity Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and results have to be interpreted with caution.With regard to pregnancy rates, we are uncertain whether there was a di erence between ongoing pregnancy rates a er glucocorticoids versus no glucocorticoids/placebo (OR 1.19, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.76; 3 RCTs, n = 476; I 2 = 0%; very low-certainty evidence) and clinical pregnancy rates a er glucocorticoids versus no glucocorticoids/placebo (OR 1.17, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.44; 13 RCTs, n = 1967; I 2 = 0%; low-certainty evidence).This suggests that if the chance of clinical pregnancy following no glucocorticoids/ placebo is assumed to be 25%, the chance following glucocorticoids would be between 24% and 32%.Furthermore, we are also uncertain whether peri-implantation glucocorticoids influenced miscarriage rates per couple (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.87; 6 RCTs, n = 821; I 2 = 0%; very low-certainty evidence), the incidence of ectopic pregnancies per couple (OR 2.28, 95% CI 0.33 to 15.62; 3 RCTs, n = 320; I 2 = 0%; very low-certainty evidence) and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) per couple (OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.90; 3 RCTs, n = 370; I 2 = 0%; very low-certainty evidence) compared to no glucocorticoids/placebo.The evidence was very low to low certainty: the main limitations were serious risk of bias due to poor reporting of study methods, and serious imprecision. Overall, there was insu icient evidence that administration of peri-implantation glucocorticoids in IVF/ICSI cycles influenced clinical outcomes.These findings were limited to the routine use of glucocorticoids in subfertile women undergoing IVF or ICSI. This review investigated whether the administration of glucocorticoids around the time of embryo implantation improved the chance of pregnancy in women undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) when compared to no glucocorticoid administration.IVF and ICSI are both treatments to help achieve pregnancy. Glucocorticoids are a class of medicines that are similar to the steroid hormones that are naturally made in the body.These medicines reduce inflammation and suppress the body\\'s immune system.Glucocorticoids suppress the inflammation of the endometrium (the tissue in the womb where the embryo implants).Therefore, glucocorticoids have been suggested to improve the chance of embryo implantation and pregnancy in women undergoing IVF or ICSI cycles. We found 16 randomised controlled trials (studies where treatments are decided at random; these usually give the most reliable evidence about treatment e ects) comparing glucocorticoids around the time of embryo implantation versus no glucocorticoids or placebo (dummy treatment), in 2232 couples undergoing IVF/ICSI.The evidence is current to 20 December 2021. Considering the quality of evidence, we are uncertain whether there was a di erence in live birth rates a er glucocorticoids.The evidence suggests that if the chance of live birth following no glucocorticoids or placebo is assumed to be 9%, the chance following glucocorticoids would be between 6% and 21%.We are also uncertain whether there was a di erence in multiple pregnancy rates (more than one embryo per pregnancy).With regard to ongoing pregnancy and clinical pregnancy rates, we are also uncertain whether there was a di erence between glucocorticoids versus no glucocorticoids or placebo.The evidence suggests that if the chance of clinical pregnancy following no glucocorticoids or placebo is assumed to be 25%, the chance following glucocorticoids would be between 24% and 32%.We are also uncertain whether there was a di erence in adverse events such as ectopic pregnancy, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (pain and swelling of the ovaries and tummy), but these were poorly and inconsistently reported. The evidence was very low to low quality.The main limitations were poor reporting of study methods and the small size of included studies.More research is needed to work out the possible role of this therapy in well-defined patient groups. Comments Despite substantial progress in the treatment of subfertile couples since the early 2000s and numerous advances in the field of in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), the live birth rate remains at 20% to 30% per treatment cycle (Banker 2021) .When a viable embryo is transferred in the uterus during an IVF cycle, there is a chance of not getting pregnant, which is called implantation failure.The failure of embryo implantation has been a source of psychological trauma for patients and disappointment for clinicians. Little progress has been made in the development of therapeutic strategies.Multiple aetiologies for implantation failure have been proposed.Focus has been on the embryo factor and the endometrial factor.Therapeutic strategies that improve the embryo factor, such as assisted hatching (artificial disruption of the outer coat of the embryo) (ASRM 2018; Knudtson 2017; Lacey 2021; Magli 1998; Stein 1995) , and pre-implantation genetic testing for aneuploidies (PGT-A) are not recommended for routine use at present (Cornelisse 2020; Munné 2019; Pehlivan 2002; Pirtea 2021) . In recent years, more attention has also focused on the endometrial factor with the aim of improving endometrial receptivity.It is increasingly recognised that the receptive endometrium denotes a range of functions that may be amenable to testing and therapeutic intervention (Saxtorph 2020) .These include the assessment and treatment of embryo-endometrial asynchrony (Simón 2020) , the diagnosis and modification of endometrial microbiota (Molina 2020; Moreno 2016) , and the targeted or blind application of intentional injury to the endometrium (also known as endometrial scratching), with the aim of increasing the chance of pregnancy.However, the e icacy of such interventions remains uncertain, and one recent Cochrane Review concluded that current evidence does not support the routine use of endometrial injury for women undergoing IVF (Lensen 2021) .A substantial amount of research has focused on the e ect of ovarian stimulation protocols on endometrial receptivity.With high oestradiol concentrations and premature progesterone elevation being reported to influence endometrial receptivity, proposed strategies to avoid this include milder stimulation protocols and segmentation by which all embryos are frozen and transferred in a later cycle (Fatemi 2013) . Much interest remains in the concept of peri-implantation immunomodulation with the aim of reducing inflammation and thus improving the intrauterine environment.Uterine receptivity is in part controlled by locally acting growth factors, cytokines and uterine natural killer (uNK) cells.Research has increased understanding of the embryo-endometrial cross-talk and progress is now being made in translating these new insights into clinically meaningful prognostic tests that can provide a rational basis of therapeutical interventions, including peri-implantation immunomodulation (Craciunas 2019; Mackens 2020; Meisner Hviid 2017; Odendaal 2021) .Prednisolone reduces preconceptual uNK cells in women with recurrent miscarriage (Quenby 2005) .Moreover, it is now clear that not just numbers of uNK cells identified are important, but also their activity and function (Lédée 2016) , and that some women with recurrent implantation failure with immune deregulation may benefit from prednisone (Lédée 2018) .Immunomodulation by glucocorticoids may therefore be beneficial in IVF.However, despite evidence pointing to immunosuppression being detrimental in some cases (Robertson 2016) , the \\'blind\\' use of glucocorticoids in this context remains widespread. Supplementary systemic administration of glucocorticoids (e.g.dehydrocortisone/prednisolone) is used in the peri-implantation period (around the time of embryo transfer) in subfertile women undergoing IVF/ICSI, since glucocorticoids are supposed to increase endometrial receptivity and, therefore, may increase the chance of embryo implantation. It has been proposed that glucocorticoids may improve the intrauterine environment by acting as immunomodulators to reduce the uNK cell count to the normal range (Lédée 2016; Quenby 2005) , and by suppression of endometrial inflammation and normalisation of the cytokine expression profile in the endometrium.Moreover, there is some evidence that glucocorticoids may also be useful in improving the ovarian response (Fridstrom 1999) , and this is the topic of another Cochrane Review (Kalampokas 2017) . The published trials on glucocorticoids for embryo implantation are insu iciently powered to draw conclusions on their e icacy and the trials reveal inconsistent results.Therefore, it seems appropriate to consider pooling the results from the available randomised controlled trials (RCTs). To evaluate the e ectiveness and safety of glucocorticoids versus no glucocorticoids administered around the time of anticipated implantation in women undergoing IVF or ICSI. We considered only truly randomised controlled trials for inclusion in this review. We excluded non-randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials. • Subfertile people, regardless of the cause of the infertility. • IVF or ICSI treatment. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. • Other types of assisted reproductive technology (ART) or spontaneous conception.• Specific subgroups of people with suggested immunological disorders such as positive antibodies, or a high number of uNK cells. We included trials that compared the e icacy of supplementary systemic administration of glucocorticoids in the peri-implantation period with a placebo or no glucocorticoids in women undergoing IVF or ICSI. We excluded trials that limited administration of glucocorticoids to the follicular phase of the cycle as they are the topic of another Cochrane Review investigating the e ects on response to ovarian stimulation (Kalampokas 2017) . Primary outcomes • Live birth rate per couple: number of live births divided by the number of randomised couples. • Incidence of multiple pregnancies: occurrences per randomised couple. • Ongoing pregnancy rate per couple: number of couples achieving a clinical pregnancy (evidence of a gestational sac with fetal heart motion at 12 weeks) divided by the number of randomised couples. (Vail 2003) .However, due to the frequency that this form of data is reported in subfertility research, it has been entered into the table of comparisons for the following outcomes. • Implantation rate, the number of fetal sacs divided by the number of embryos transferred.• Incidence of miscarriage per total number of pregnancies. • Incidence of multiple pregnancies per total number of pregnancies. We searched for all published and unpublished RCTs, without language restriction, in consultation with the CGF Group Information Specialist, on 20 December 2021.We handsearched the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) and American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) abstract books.A full description is given in the Group\\'s module on the Cochrane Library (see cgf.cochrane.org). We searched the following databases: • the CGF Group\\'s Specialised Register of Controlled Trials, ProCite platform (searched 20 December 2021) (Appendix 1); We searched the citation lists of relevant publications, review articles, abstracts of scientific meetings and included studies.We contacted experts in the field for any additional trials.Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews trialsearch/Default.aspx) were included in the CENTRAL search output. We also searched the Epistemonikos database (www.epistemonikos.org/),a multilingual database of health evidence (the largest source of systematic reviews and also other scientific evidence). For this review update, two review authors (CB and MSK) independently conducted an initial screen of titles and abstracts retrieved by the search.We retrieved the full texts of all potentially eligible studies.Two review authors (CB and MSK) independently examined these full-text articles for compliance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria and selected the studies eligible for inclusion.If necessary, we sought additional information on trial methodology and original trial data from the authors.We resolved disagreements by discussion.We documented the selection process in a PRISMA flow chart.We extracted study characteristics and data from the included studies and presented them in the Characteristics of included studies table. Two review authors (CB and MSK) independently extracted the data and assessed the quality of the trials. Two review authors (CB and SDK, and CB and MSK for the current update of the review) independently assessed the risk of bias for each study.Judgements were assigned as recommended in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions Section 8.5 (Higgins 2011) .We resolved disagreements by discussion.We described all judgements fully and presented the conclusions in the risk of bias table, which was incorporated into the interpretation of review findings by means of sensitivity analyses (see below). Random sequence generation describes the method used to generate the allocation sequence.Biased allocation to interventions would result in a selection bias. • Truly randomised (e.g. by computer, random number tables or drawing lots).• Quasi-randomised (e.g. by hospital number or date of birth): these studies were not included in the meta-analysis.• Not clear (e.g.stated but not further described). Allocation concealment describes the method used to conceal the allocation sequence.Biased allocation to interventions due to inadequate concealment of allocations prior to assignment would result in a selection and performance bias. • Yes (e.g.sealed in opaque envelopes, computerised allocation in a non-participating centre): low risk of bias.• Unclear (not stated): unclear risk of bias. • No (e.g.open list of random numbers, open envelopes, tables): high risk of bias. Bias due to knowledge of the allocated interventions by participants and personnel during the study can result in a performance or detection bias. Bias due to knowledge of the allocated interventions by outcome assessors can result in detection bias.However, the primary and secondary outcomes live birth rate and (ongoing) pregnancy rate, were not susceptible to this type of bias. Attrition bias is a type of selection bias caused by attrition (loss of participants) and includes dropouts, protocol deviations and withdrawals.We assessed dropout rates (less than 10%), reasons for dropping out, duration of follow-up and selective loss to followup, the number of and reason for cancelled cycles (less than 10%), and whether or not studies used an intention-to-treat analysis. Within-study selective reporting bias applies to the failure to report outcomes within studies.This bias was assessed by considering whether individual studies reported all relevant and expected outcomes. Publication bias is a form of reporting bias referring to the review as a whole rather than individual studies.It refers to the phenomenon by which trials with positive results are more likely to be published (and thus identified) than trials with negative results (Begg 1989 ).Publication bias is detected by the construction of a funnel plot, plotting sample size versus e ects size.In the absence of publication bias, the graph is symmetrical.The number of trials needed to construct a funnel plot is arbitrarily a minimum of 10 studies. We assessed other sources of potential bias such as conflict of interest. For dichotomous data (e.g.live birth rates), we used the numbers of events in the control and intervention groups of each study to calculate Mantel-Haenszel odds ratios (ORs).We presented 95% confidence intervals (CI) for all outcomes. The primary analysis was per couple randomised.Per pregnancy data were included for some outcomes (e.g.miscarriage, multiple pregnancy rates) and implantation rate per embryo transferred: these data do not allow valid analysis and are shown but not metaanalysed. For included studies, we noted levels of attrition in the Characteristics of included studies tables.We analysed the data on an intention-to-treat basis as far as possible. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. We examined heterogeneity between the results of di erent studies by inspecting the scatter in the data points and the overlap in their CIs, and more formally by checking the results of the Chi 2 test. Thresholds for the interpretation of the I 2 statistic can be misleading, since the importance of inconsistency depends on several factors.An approximate guide to interpretation in the context of meta-analyses of RCTs is as follows (Higgins 2021 ): • 0% to 40%: might not be important; • 30% to 60%: may represent moderate heterogeneity; • 50% to 90%: may represent substantial heterogeneity; • 75% to 100%: considerable heterogeneity. Clinical heterogeneity in subfertility cannot be avoided because most centres use their own materials and methods, which can di er in several ways.When trials met the inclusion criteria and they had performed the same intervention, we considered it appropriate to pool their results. In view of the di iculty of detecting and correcting for publication bias and other reporting biases, we aimed to minimise their potential impact by ensuring a comprehensive search for eligible studies and by being alert for duplication of data.If there were 10 or more studies in an analysis, we used a funnel plot to explore the possibility of publication bias (small-study e ects: a tendency for estimates of the intervention e ect to be more beneficial in smaller studies). If the studies were su iciently similar, we combined the data using a fixed-e ect model.We performed statistical analysis using Review Manager 5 (Review Manager 2014). We performed the following subgroup analyses: • including women who underwent IVF and studies including women who underwent ICSI (the e ect of glucocorticoids on pregnancy rates might be higher in women undergoing IVF rather than ICSI; in women undergoing ICSI an andrological cause of infertility is more likely, than an intrauterine immune disturbance); • including only women with tubal factor infertility and studies including women with male factor infertility only; • using di erent dosages (high versus low dose).And timing of glucocorticoid administration: around the time of embryo implantation versus studies providing glucocorticoids around the time of embryo transfer and not during the phase of embryo implantation.The dosages of all prescribed glucocorticoids were converted to an equivalent dosage of prednisolone (Corticosteroid Conversion Calculator -ClinCalc.com;clincalc.com/corticosteroids/). The following planned analyses were not performed as no studies were identified that met the criteria: • studies including only women with unexplained infertility or recurrent implantation failure, which is usually defined as three or more failed attempts of IVF or ICSI, or implantation failure a er the replacement of more than 10 embryos (El-Toukhy 2006); • studies using di erent methods of administration (parenteral versus oral). If more than five trials for a particular endpoint were included in the meta-analysis, we performed the following sensitivity analyses to examine stability regarding the direction of outcomes, using: • a random-e ects model in addition to the fixed-e ect model; • studies that used adequate concealment of allocation; • studies reporting the method of randomisation. We prepared a summary of findings The included and excluded studies are described in the Characteristics of included studies and Characteristics of excluded studies tables. The search identified 68 studies which potentially provided data comparing peri-implantation glucocorticoids versus no glucocorticoids or a placebo in ART.Further evaluation based on the inclusion criteria resulted in 16 studies being eligible for inclusion in this review (Ando 1996; Bider 1996-1; Bider 1996-2; Botti 1998; Catt 1994; Duvan 2006; Ezzeldin 2003; Kemeter 1986; Kim 1997; Mo itt 1995; Mohammadi 2018; Mottla 1996; Nanbakhsh 2014; Salah Edeen 2009; Tan 1992; Ubaldi 2002 ; see Characteristics of included studies table ).Full agreement existed between the two review authors concerning inclusion or exclusion of trials.A PRISMA flow chart of the results of the initial and updated search is included (Figure 1 ).Two of these studies were included in the review, but excluded from the meta-analysis (Ando 1996; Kim 1997) .These studies included more than one cycle per woman.These data are not appropriate for statistical pooling because data per cycle will result in an unit of analysis error. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Two other studies are awaiting classification (Beltran 2020; ChiCTR1800018783; see Characteristics of studies awaiting classification table ).ChiCTR1800018783 is a study protocol of an RCT comparing prednisone versus placebo in people undergoing frozen thawed embryo transfer a er IVF/ICSI.Beltran 2020 is an abstract of an RCT comparing methylprednisolone versus placebo in a subgroup of women with a high risk of OHSS.It is unsure whether these women had an embryo transfer despite their OHSS, and there are no data that are pregnancy related. Fi y studies did not meet the inclusion criteria for one or more reasons as outlined in the Characteristics of excluded studiestable. The 16 RCTs were single-centre studies except for Mo itt 1995.Mo itt 1995 was performed in three centres for reproductive medicine in the USA.One study used of cross-over design (Ubaldi 2002) .However, a preliminary abstract reported outcomes of the first cycle only (Ubaldi 2000) .These data have been included in the meta-analysis. The total number of trial participants was 2232.Three studies included women with a variety of causes of infertility (Ando 1996; Duvan 2006; Mo itt 1995) . Botti 1998, Mottla 1996, and  Two studies were included in the review but excluded from metaanalysis (Ando 1996; Kim 1997 ): Kim 1997 included two di erent populations of women: endometriosis and tubal factor or only tubal factor.Among women with endometriosis and tubal factor, 38.1% had positive titres for autoantibodies.Since this systematic review focused on the routine use of glucocorticoids to improve implantation, only the results of the second group of women with tubal factor infertility were shown.Ando 1996 included data from women who were positive and women who were negative for autoantibodies; data from autoantibody negative women were shown. Studies used a variety of di erent protocols for glucocorticoid administration.The type of glucocorticoid di ered: (methyl)prednisolone (Botti 1998; Catt 1994; Duvan 2006; Ezzeldin 2003; Kemeter 1986; Kim 1997; Mohammadi 2018; Mo itt 1995; Mottla 1996; Nanbakhsh 2014; Salah Edeen 2009; Ubaldi 2002) , dexamethasone (Bider 1996-1; Bider 1996-2) , and hydrocortisone combined with prednisolone (Tan 1992).Ando 1996 prescribed either dexamethasone or prednisolone with no explanation of the basis for choosing which to give. The dose schedules and length of treatment were also variable. Methylprednisolone was used at a dose of: 16 mg per day (Botti 1998; Catt 1994; Mohammadi 2018 ) or 4 mg per day (Mo itt 1995).Prednisolone was used in a dose of: 5 mg per day (Ando 1996) , 7.5 mg per day (Kemeter 1986) , 10 mg per day (Duvan 2006; Ubaldi 2002) , 15 mg per day (Ezzeldin 2003) , 20 mg per day (Nanbakhsh 2014; Salah Edeen 2009), or 60 mg per day (Mottla 1996) .Nanbakhsh 2014 provided prednisolone 20 mg per day in the first seven days and continued with 10 mg per day for the next seven days.Kim 1997 prescribed 10 mg per day during ovarian hyperstimulation and 60 mg per day from oocyte retrieval onwards.Controls and study participants in Ubaldi 2002 also received aspirin for four weeks.Dexamethasone was used at 0.5 mg per day by Ando 1996 and Bider 1996 -2, although Bider 1996 -1 enrolled participants either receiving 0.5 per day or 1 mg per day (cumulative results from both treatment groups were calculated).Tan 1992 administered intravenous hydrocortisone 100 mg a er oocyte retrieval and started prednisolone 30 mg per day for five days, 20 mg per day for three days and 10 mg per day for two days.All other studies only used oral regimens. Glucocorticoids were provided during the luteal phase, follicular phase, or both.They were administered from ovarian hyperstimulation onwards by Ando 1996 , Kemeter 1986 , Kim 1997 , Mohammadi 2018 , Ubaldi 2002 (until four days a er oocyte retrieval) and Bider 1996-1 (until one day a er embryo transfer).In addition, glucocorticoids were administered from oocyte retrieval onwards by Mottla 1996 1998 and Salah Edeen 2009; and IVF in Ando 1996 , Bider 1996 -1, Kemeter 1986 , Kim 1997 , Mo itt 1995 , Mohammadi 2018 , Mottla 1996 , and Tan 1992 .Only one study used subzonal sperm injection (SUZI) (Catt 1994), which involves direct placement of sperm into the space between the zona pellucida and the oocyte.This technique is comparable to, but less invasive for the oocyte than, ICSI.In addition to IVF cycles, Mo itt 1995 also included transfer cycles of frozen-thawed embryos.Bider 1996-2 only included transfers of frozen-thawed embryos obtained a er IVF treatment. Kemeter 1986 was an older study which used a di erent ovarian stimulation protocol, by using clomiphene in combination with gonadotrophins without gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue treatment. Three studies assessed the primary outcome of live birth rate per couple (Ando 1996; Bider 1996-1; Mo itt 1995) .Bider 1996-2 and Mo itt 1995 only reported preliminary results due to incomplete follow-up, and we excluded the remaining study from metaanalysis (Ando 1996) .All studies except Salah Edeen 2009 reported the clinical pregnancy rate per couple.However, three studies reported pregnancy rate rather than clinical pregnancy rate (Bider 1996-1; Bider 1996-2; Botti 1998) .Nine trials reported any of the other considered outcomes of adverse e ects, namely multiple pregnancy rate (five RCTs), miscarriage rate (eight RCTs) and the incidence of ectopic pregnancies (four RCTs).Three studies investigated the incidence of OHSS (Mohammadi 2018; Salah Edeen 2009; Tan 1992) . Bider 1996 -2, Duvan 2006 , and Mottla 1996 described adverse e ects of glucocorticoids. Fi y studies did not meet the inclusion criteria for one or more reasons as outlined in the Characteristics of excluded studies table.Most excluded trials did not use a random design or did not compare peri-implantation glucocorticoids versus no glucocorticoid in the target population.Several trials investigated glucocorticoids in combination with aspirin/low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or compared glucocorticoids in women undergoing ovulation induction/intrauterine insemination (IUI) rather than IVF or ICSI.One study reported only in abstract form without data (Shohayeb 2005).We were unsuccessful in contacting the authors.However, the study was also excluded because all participants were women with anti-thyroid antibodies.One study with incomplete data due to premature termination was also excluded (Dmowski 1995) ; shortly a er beginning this trial, the team moved out of the institution and the trial was discontinued.Some studies were excluded because they only included women with autoantibodies or a high number of peripheral CD69+ natural killer (NK) cells. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Two studies are awaiting classification (Beltran 2020; ChiCTR1800018783; Characteristics of studies awaiting classification table ). We found no ongoing studies. The risk of bias of the studies is summarised in Figure 2 and Figure 3 .As can be concluded from this graph, only a small number of included studies used blinding of the study participants and personnel, only a limited number of studies reported the primary outcome of interest (live birth rate) and only one study addressed the number of dropouts and the handling of these data. The risk of selection bias related both to sequence generation and allocation concealment; grades were low risk, unclear or high risk. No studies were at high risk of selection bias. Eleven studies were at low risk of selection bias related to sequence generation as they used computer randomisation, random numbers table or envelopes (Bider 1996-1; Bider 1996-2; Catt 1994; Duvan 2006; Kim 1997; Mo itt 1995; Mohammadi 2018; Mottla 1996; Salah Edeen 2009; Tan 1992; Ubaldi 2002) .The other five studies did not describe the exact method used and had an unclear risk of this bias. Five studies were at low risk of selection bias related to allocation concealment (Catt 1994; Mo itt 1995; Mottla 1996; Salah Edeen 2009; Tan 1992) .Mottla 1996 randomised participants to receive identically packaged placebo or glucocorticoids using a table of random numbers.A pharmacist not involved in the allocation encoded identical tablets or placebo in Catt 1994 and Mo itt 1995.Salah Edeen 2009 and Tan 1992 randomised participants by drawing sealed opaque, sequentially numbered envelopes. Three studies comparing corticosteroid use with a placebo blinded participants (Catt 1994; Mo itt 1995; Mottla 1996) .All three studies were double blind.Although the outcome pregnancy/live birth is objective, we categorised studies without blinding at high risk of performance bias as it is possible that participants in the control arm could access the corticosteroids from other sources.Moreover, for adverse e ects and other subjective secondary outcomes blinding status could potentially a ect findings.The remaining studies were not blinded and were at high risk of performance and detection bias. Six studies were at high risk of attrition bias (Ando 1996; Bider 1996-2; Kemeter 1986; Mo itt 1995; Mohammadi 2018; Ubaldi 2002) . Kemeter 1986 and Mohammadi 2018 reported a high rate of cancelled cycles (19 and 14%, respectively).Neither study used an intention-to-treat analysis; however, we used an intention to treat principle including the data of Mohammadi 2018 in the meta-analysis.In Mohammadi 2018, transparency of dealing with dropouts was good; however, 30% of participants did not receive an embryo transfer because of a high risk of OHSS, which also increases risk of bias for our outcome clinical pregnancy.Kemeter 1986 used an atypical method of dealing with dropouts: in 34 participants the IVF treatment was cancelled.Among these participants, 22 did not receive glucocorticoids and 12 did receive glucocorticoids.The authors equalised the di erence in the number of dropouts between the two study arms by removing at random an additional 10 participants from the glucocorticoid group.This method, rather than using an intention to treat analysis, resulted in an underestimation of the treatment e ect of glucocorticoids.We were unsuccessful in contacting the study authors. Ubaldi 2002 reported the number of cancelled cycles and the reasons for cancellation.The number of cancelled cycles was greater than 10% (45/360 cycles): 32 cycles had only one embryo transferred, 10 cycles were had poor response, and three cycles had a risk of OHSS.A high risk of bias may have been present since glucocorticoids were provided from controlled ovarian hyperstimulation onwards and may have influenced ovarian stimulation and embryo quality. Few studies reported data on follow-up or dropouts. Bider 1996-2 and Mo itt 1995 reported data on live birth rates; however, these data were preliminary due to incomplete follow-up. Three studies performed a prospective power calculation (Duvan 2006; Mo itt 1995; Tan 1992) . Ezzeldin 2003 and Mottla 1996 performed a retrospective power analysis.One study employed analysis on the basis of intention to treat (pregnancy rate per initiated cycle) (Tan 1992). A study protocol was available for Mohammadi 2018 and was therefore classified as a low risk of selective reporting.All studies reported the outcomes that they planned to in their methods section.We classified the studies that did not report any adverse events at high risk of selective reporting (Bider 1996-1; Botti 1998; Duvan 2006; Ezzeldin 2003) .Salah Edeen 2009 was at high risk of selective reporting since there were no data on pregnancy or live birth rates, only the risk of OHSS. Three studies assessed the primary outcome, namely \\'live birth rate per couple\\' (Ando 1996; Bider 1996-1; Mo itt 1995) .However, this primary outcome is o en not reported in fertility studies presumably because of the need for long follow-up. A funnel plot of precision versus OR showed a suggestion of publication bias for clinical pregnancy rate per couple (Figure 4 ).Results from the largest and third largest studies showed negative results, suggesting we do not have a fully representative set of studies.Publication bias would result in an overestimation of the e ect.

Clinical pregnancy rate per couple (primary analysis) Subgroup in vitro fertilisation Subgroup intracytoplasmic sperm injection The risk of other biases was unclear in six studies.Regarding baseline comparability, four studies provided no data on maternal age to assess the comparability of the two intervention groups (Bider 1996-2; Botti 1998; Mottla 1996; Nanbakhsh 2014) .Therefore, baseline comparability of other potential prognostic factors, such as prior IVF attempts, cause and length of infertility, semen quality and dose of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), was unclear.Four studies were abstracts that did not describe their methods in detail (Botti 1998; Ezzeldin 2003; Nanbakhsh 2014; Salah Edeen 2009 ).We found no potential sources of within-study bias in the other 10 studies. Use of cross-over data was a source of potential bias in one study (Ubaldi 2002) .However, a preliminary abstract reported outcomes of the first cycle only (Ubaldi 2000) .These data have been included in the meta-analysis. We examined heterogeneity between the results of di erent studies by inspecting the scatter in the data points and the overlap in their CIs, and more formally by checking the results of the Chi 2 test. The data points and overlap in CIs did not suggest heterogeneity in results.The I 2 statistic was 0% in all analyses except for multiple pregnancy per couple (53%).The I 2 statistic of 53% may represent moderate statistical heterogeneity.It is essential to consider the extent to which the results of studies are consistent with each other.However, since clinical and methodological diversities always occur in a meta-analysis, statistical heterogeneity is inevitable.We explored the heterogeneity; however, the number of studies was low, the sample sizes were small and the number of multiple pregnancies was very low.The results among the di erent studies all crossed the line of no e ect.The results of multiple pregnancy rate per couple had to be interpreted with caution though. See: Summary of findings 1 Glucocorticoids compared to no glucocorticoids or placebo for assisted reproductive technology cycles The results are summarised in Summary of findings 1. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. We are uncertain whether peri-implantation glucocorticoids influenced live birth rates compared to no glucocorticoids/placebo (OR 1.37, 95% CI 0.69 to 2.71; 2 RCTs, n = 366; I 2 =7%; very low-certainty evidence; Analysis 1.1; Figure 5 ) (Bider 1996-2; Mo itt 1995) .This suggests that if the chance of live birth following no glucocorticoids/placebo is assumed to be 9%, the chance following glucocorticoids would be between 6% and 21%.The results from Bider 1996-2 and Mo itt 1995 were preliminary due to incomplete follow-up until birth.We included the data in the meta-analysis, since it is unlikely to a ect the relative e ect estimates. We are uncertain whether peri-implantation glucocorticoids influenced the rate of multiple pregnancies per couple compared to no glucocorticoids/placebo (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.33 to 2.20; 4 RCTs, n = 504; I 2 = 53%; very low-certainty evidence; Analysis 1.2) (Bider 1996-2; Catt 1994; Mohammadi 2018; Mottla 1996) .This suggests that if the chance of a multiple pregnancy per couple following no glucocorticoids/placebo is assumed to be 4%, the chance following glucocorticoids would be between 1% and 8%.The results of multiple pregnancy rate per couple have to be interpreted with caution since an I 2 statistic of 53% may represent moderate statistical heterogeneity. The results from the multiple pregnancy rate per pregnancy, which were not statistically pooled, showed no di erence in both treatment groups (Analysis 1.3). We are uncertain whether peri-implantation glucocorticoids influenced the ongoing pregnancy rate per couple compared to no glucocorticoids/placebo (OR 1.19, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.76; 3 RCTs, n = 476; I 2 = 0%; very low-certainty evidence; Analysis 1.4) (Mo itt 1995; Mottla 1996; Nanbakhsh 2014) .This suggests that if the chance of an ongoing pregnancy following no glucocorticoids/placebo is assumed to be 28%, the chance following glucocorticoids would be between 24% and 41%. Thirteen studies reported clinical pregnancy rates per couple and were included in the meta-analysis (Bider 1996-1; Bider 1996-2; Botti 1998; Catt 1994; Duvan 2006; Ezzeldin 2003; Kemeter 1986; Mo itt 1995; Mohammadi 2018; Mottla 1996; Nanbakhsh 2014; Tan 1992; Ubaldi 2002) .We are uncertain whether peri-implantation glucocorticoids influenced clinical pregnancy rates per couple compared to no glucocorticoids/placebo (OR 1.17, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.44; 13 RCTs, n = 1967; I 2 = 0%; low-certainty evidence; Analysis 1.5; Figure 6 ).The evidence suggests that if the chance of clinical pregnancy following no glucocorticoids/placebo is assumed to be 25%, the chance following glucocorticoids would be between 24% and 32%.Total events: Heterogeneity: Chi² = 6.13, df = 12 (P = 0.91); I² = 0% Test for overall effect: Z = 1.47 (P = 0.14) We performed a sensitivity analysis of four studies that used adequate concealment of allocation (Catt 1994; Mo itt 1995; Mottla 1996; Tan 1992) .There was insu icient evidence to determine whether peri-implantation glucocorticoids influenced clinical pregnancy rates compared to no glucocorticoids/placebo in this selection of studies (OR 1.23, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.83). We performed an analysis of nine studies reporting the method of randomisation (Bider 1996-1; Bider 1996-2; Catt 1994; Duvan 2006; Mo itt 1995; Mohammadi 2018; Mottla 1996; Tan 1992; Ubaldi 2002) .It was unclear whether peri-implantation glucocorticoids influenced clinical pregnancy rates compared to no glucocorticoids/placebo in this selection of studies (OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.52). A sensitivity analysis with application of a random-e ects model revealed similar results (OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.43). We are uncertain of the e ect of glucocorticoids on clinical pregnancy rates in a subgroup of women who underwent IVF rather than ICSI (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.08; 5 RCTs, n = 724; I 2 = 0%; very low-certainty evidence; Figure 6 ) (Bider 1996-1; Kemeter 1986; Mo itt 1995; Mohammadi 2018 with exclusion of cryo-thawed embryo transfer cycles; Mottla 1996) .Application of a randome ects model revealed similar results (OR 1.43, 95% CI 0.98 to 2.07), as would be expected since the I 2 statistic was 0%.We are uncertain whether there was an e ect of peri-implantation glucocorticoid administration on clinical pregnancy rates in a subgroup of women undergoing ICSI or SUZI (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.42; 6 RCTs, n = 992; I 2 = 0%; very low-certainty evidence; Figure 6 ) (Catt 1994; Duvan 2006; Ezzeldin 2003; Nanbakhsh 2014; Tan 1992; Ubaldi 2002) . We performed a second subgroup analysis for cause of infertility, namely subgroup analyses of studies including women with tubal factor infertility (Bider 1996-1; Bider 1996-2) , or male factor infertility only (Catt 1994; Ezzeldin 2003; Ubaldi 2002) .We are uncertain whether peri-implantation glucocorticoids influenced clinical pregnancy rates compared to no glucocorticoids/placebo in women with tubal factor infertility or male factor infertility only (tubal factor infertility: OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.43 to 2.46; male factor infertility: OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.38).No other subgroup analyses on cause of infertility could be performed. The third subgroup analysis was on the dosage and timing of glucocorticoids.The dosages of all prescribed glucocorticoids were converted to an equivalent dosage of prednisolone (Corticosteroid Conversion Calculator -ClinCalc.com;clincalc.com/corticosteroids/).Studies using prednisolone at more than 10 mg per day during the luteal phase (Botti 1998; Catt 1994; Ezzeldin 2003; Mohammadi 2018; Mottla 1996; Nanbakhsh 2014; Tan 1992) , and studies using prednisolone at 10 mg per day or less (Bider 1996-1; Bider 1996-2; Duvan 2006; Kemeter 1986; Mo itt 1995; Ubaldi 2002) , were analysed separately.We are uncertain whether both a lower dose of prednisolone and a higher dose of prednisolone around the time of implantation influenced clinical pregnancy rates compared to no glucocorticoids/placebo (lower dose prednisolone versus no glucocorticoids/placebo: OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.67; higher dose prednisolone versus no glucocorticoids/placebo: OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.50; both very low-certainty evidence; Analysis 1.6).Application of a random-e ects model revealed similar results. The anticipated day of embryo implantation was approximately eight to 10 days a er ovulation (Wilcox 1999) .Seven studies administered glucocorticoids around the time of embryo implantation (Duvan 2006; Ezzeldin 2003; Kemeter 1986; Mohammadi 2018; Nanbakhsh 2014; Tan 1992; Ubaldi 2002) , other studies provided glucocorticoids around the time of embryo transfer rather than embryo implantation.We are also uncertain whether glucocorticoids influenced clinical pregnancy rates compared to no glucocorticoids/placebo in a subgroup of studies that administered glucocorticoids around the time of implantation rather than embryo transfer (OR 1.17, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.52; very low-certainty evidence; Analysis 1.6); application of a random-e ects model revealed similar results. All subgroup and sensitivity analyses indicated that the results were relatively robust around this variable. We are uncertain whether peri-implantation glucocorticoids influenced miscarriage rates per couple compared to no glucocorticoids/placebo (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.87; 6 RCTs, n = 821; I 2 = 0%; very low-certainty evidence; Analysis 1.7) (Bider 1996-2; Kemeter 1986; Mo itt 1995; Mottla 1996; Nanbakhsh 2014; Ubaldi 2002 ).The random-e ects model confirmed this result. We performed sensitivity analyses of studies that used adequate concealment of allocation (Mo itt 1995; Mottla 1996) , and studies reporting the method of randomisation (Bider 1996-1; Kemeter 1986; Mo itt 1995; Mottla 1996; Ubaldi 2002) .We are uncertain whether peri-implantation glucocorticoids influenced miscarriage rates compared to no glucocorticoids/placebo in these two subgroups (adequate concealment of allocation: OR 1.42, CI 0.69 to 2.94; reporting the method of randomisation: OR 1.28, CI 0.69 to 2.36).The results from the number of miscarriages per total number of pregnancies were not statistically pooled. We are uncertain whether peri-implantation glucocorticoids influenced the incidence of ectopic pregnancies per couple compared to no glucocorticoids/placebo (OR 2.28, 95% CI 0.33 to 15.62; 3 RCTs; n = 320; I 2 = 0%; very low-certainty evidence; Analysis 1.9) (Bider 1996-2; Kemeter 1986; Mottla 1996) . Bider 1996 -2, Duvan 2006 , and Mottla 1996 described the incidence of adverse e ects from glucocorticoids; since there were no documented cases in the control or placebo and glucocorticoid groups, the OR could not be estimated. No studies reported infection rate following oocyte retrieval Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. We are uncertain whether peri-implantation glucocorticoids influenced the incidence of OHSS per couple compared to no glucocorticoids/placebo (OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.90; 3 RCTs, n = 370; I 2 = 0%; very low-certainty evidence; Analysis 1.10) (Mohammadi 2018; Salah Edeen 2009; Tan 1992) . No studies reported fetal abnormalities. Ten studies reported implantation rate per embryo transferred (Ando 1996; Botti 1998; Catt 1994; Duvan 2006; Ezzeldin 2003; Mo itt 1995; Mohammadi 2018; Mottla 1996; Tan 1992; Ubaldi 2002) .The results are presented but not statistically pooled.All studies crossed the line of no e ect and revealed an OR around 1.0 or showed a moderate trend favouring glucocorticoids.Only Botti 1998 showed a trend that favoured controls. The aim of this review was to evaluate the e ectiveness and safety of glucocorticoids administered around the time of implantation, in women undergoing IVF or ICSI in whom no assessment of endometrial immune status had taken place, when compared to no glucocorticoid or placebo administration.Overall there is insu icient evidence to indicate a beneficial e ect of periimplantation glucocorticoids on clinical outcomes when used in this way (Summary of findings 1).We are uncertain whether there was a di erence in the live birth or clinical pregnancy rate a er administration of glucocorticoids in women undergoing IVF or ICSI versus no glucocorticoids/placebo.We are also uncertain about the e ect of glucocorticoids versus no glucocorticoids/placebo on the clinical pregnancy rate in a subgroup of women who underwent IVF rather than ICSI (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.08).The results of this subgroup should be interpreted with caution since overall certainty of the evidence was very low.Similarly, we are uncertain whether there is a di erence in the multiple pregnancy rate following administration of glucocorticoids versus no glucocorticoids or placebo in women undergoing IVF or ICSI. Adverse e ects were also considered as a secondary outcome.We are uncertain about possible negative e ects of glucocorticoids such as adverse e ects or OHSS, but these were poorly reported.Only three trials reported the incidence of adverse e ects from glucocorticoids and there were no cases documented.No studies reported the incidence of infections or fetal abnormalities. Live birth rate is the standard primary outcome for RCTs of this nature (Vail 2003) .Two trials included in the meta-analysis reported this outcome and there was insu icient evidence for a beneficial e ect of glucocorticoids (Bider 1996-1; Mo itt 1995) .Using clinical pregnancy rate as a surrogate endpoint is of dubious accuracy.Thirteen RCTs included in the meta-analysis reported clinical pregnancy rate.These results could not easily be extrapolated to live birth rate due to the high rate of multiple pregnancies and subsequent higher rates of perinatal mortality. These findings are limited to the empirical use of glucocorticoids (routine use in a non-selected IVF or ICSI population) and cannot be extrapolated to women with unexplained infertility, endometriosis or recurrent implantation failure since we were unable to make subgroups of these women.None of the included studies focused on these patient subgroups.With these underlying conditions, women may have a higher chance of benefiting from peri-implantation glucocorticoids since an impaired intrauterine environment could be a cause for their infertility and immunomodulation may improve endometrial receptivity. Our results cannot be extrapolated to women with positive autoantibodies.Geva 2000 and Ando 1996 administered glucocorticoids to women with antinuclear, antidouble-stranded DNA, anticardiolipin antibodies and lupus anticoagulant in an RCT; there were promising results.Another RCT investigated women with tubal factor infertility and endometriosis, of whom 38% were positive for autoantibodies (Kim 1997) ; women in this study receiving glucocorticoids showed significantly higher pregnancy rates versus the controls.This was not confirmed by Shohayeb 2005, who investigated glucocorticoids in women with antithyroid antibodies and found no significant di erences in pregnancy rates. Overall, the certainty of the evidence was very low to low.The level of certainty was downgraded using GRAD, mainly because of possible selection bias (unclear method of randomisation and allocation concealment), performance bias (due to lack blinding), attrition bias and serious imprecision (wide CIs due to small sample size and small number of events).The meta-analysis included only RCTs.No studies were graded at high risk of selection bias related to sequence generation or allocation concealment.Sample sizes were relatively small.However, many fertility trials lack power.A prospective power calculation should always be performed although the calculated sample size in most cases will be prohibitively large. There are several methodological considerations to be considered when interpreting these results as there was substantial heterogeneity between the 14 trials in the meta-analysis.Although there was no significant heterogeneity between trials for live birth rate and pregnancy rates, di erences in clinical parameters were o en considerable (clinical heterogeneity).Clinical heterogeneity cannot be avoided because most centres use their own materials and methods.The underlying assumption when similar trials are pooled is that di erences found between the trials are likely to be di erences in the extent of treatment e ect rather than direction of treatment e ect.For example, clinical heterogeneity between the studies may result in di erent outcomes between the studies but they all show more or less the same trend in treatment e ect.Moreover, when all trials find similar results despite di erences in clinical parameters, this renders more robust conclusions drawn. The cause of infertility, type of ART and intervention protocol all varied considerably between the trials.Most importantly, there was no uniformity of dose and timing of the intervention.Subgroup analyses of higher and lower doses of corticosteroids and timing (during or before implantation) revealed no di erences in pregnancy rates with glucocorticoid administrations versus controls; there was no apparent dose-response relationship. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews However, most trials included a mix of the three factors.As a result, the e ect of individual confounders could not be assessed. Heterogeneity existed between the trials with regards to most aspects of trial methodology.Ezzeldin 2003 was most heavily weighted in the meta-analysis due to its large sample size (526 participants), but this abstract did not report the method of randomisation and concealment of allocation.Only three studies were double-blind by using a placebo, which may have introduced bias in the other studies.However, these trials did not show unusual results.In order to investigate the e ect of methodological quality on treatment e ect, we performed sensitivity analyses on studies with an adequate concealment of allocation and studies in which the method of randomisation was described.These sensitivity analyses did not reveal a change in treatment e ect. The results of multiple pregnancy rate per couple have to be interpreted with caution since an I 2 statistic of 53% may represent moderate statistical heterogeneity. A funnel plot of precision versus OR showed a suggestion of publication bias for the clinical pregnancy rate per couple (Figure 4 ), which is reason to believe that the set of studies is not fully representative.Publication bias would result in an overestimation of treatment e ect.This has to be taken into account when interpreting the results.Even though there is some evidence of publication bias, there was no evidence of significant treatment e ects.No studies reported funding streams. The search was comprehensive and included clinical trial registries for ongoing trials.However, there is a possibility that some studies may have been missed. We identified no other review or meta-analysis that evaluated use of glucocorticoids in the peri-implantation period in women without any underlying autoimmune disorder who were undergoing ART. In women with autoimmune conditions undergoing ART, use of corticosteroids alone or in combination with low-dose aspirin has been reported to improve treatment outcomes (Geva 2000; Revelli 2009).One recent systematic review including three studies reported improvement in clinical pregnancy and live birth rates following glucocorticoids in women with antithyroid antibodies undergoing ART (Zhou 2021) . Overall, there was insu icient evidence that administration of peri-implantation glucocorticoids in in vitro fertilisation (IVF)/ intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles influenced the clinical outcome.These findings were limited to the routine use of glucocorticoids in subfertile women undergoing IVF or ICSI, and cannot be extrapolated to women with autoantibodies, unexplained infertility or recurrent implantation failure.Further well-designed randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are required to elucidate the possible role of this therapy in well-defined patient groups.Overall, certainty of evidence was very low to low. The authors would like to thank several people for helping in the construction of this review. • Study also included a group of antibody-positive women.We have not included these results in the analysis.

Uterine fibroids (also known as leiomyomas and myomas; UFs) are benign lesions or neoplasms of the uterus that are composed of smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts and are rich in extracellular matrix.They may cause heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding that can lead to chronic anaemia.Uterine fibroids can also enlarge the uterus and this enlargement can lead to \\'bulk symptoms\\' -for example, urinary symptoms (such as increased urinary frequency, nocturia, urgency incontinence or urinary retention) or gastrointestinal symptoms (such as diarrhoea or constipation)in addition to abdominal distention or acyclic pelvic pain.These symptoms may considerably impair women\\'s quality of life (Moroni 2014) .Whilst ultrasonography studies show prevalence rates of uterine fibroids to exceed 70%, clinical fibroid symptoms are felt in 25% to 50% of all women; these data represent a self-report diagnosis of 12.8 per 1000 person-years to 2 per 1000 person-years for hysterectomy-confirmed cases in the USA (Whiteman 2010) .The most recurrent risk factor reported to increase the fibroid risk is black race, followed by increasing age (until the perimenopausal transition), premenopausal state, hypertension, family history and others (Stewart 2017) .Fibroids may also a ect a woman\\'s fertility; it is known that uterine fibroids may cause cavity distortion and alteration of endometrial receptivity (Whynott 2017) , and this may or may not cause symptoms. Pelvic ultrasonography remains the primary imaging modality for the diagnosis of uterine fibroids, owing to the benefits of wide availability and low cost associated with this test, in addition to the reliable identification of calcified fibroids and the detection of larger, clinically relevant fibroids.Sensitivity and specificity for ultrasonography are 90% and 87%, respectively, and are improved with the addition of sonohysterography (instilling saline into the uterine cavity through the cervix) (up to 100% and 98%, respectively).Magnetic resonance imaging presents the highest sensitivity and specificity indexes for UF diagnosis (Stewart 2016) . Uterine fibroids seem to develop and regulate gene expression in response to menstrual cyclicity and the action of gonadal steroids (mainly oestrogen and progesterone); they induce symptomatology between first occurrence of menstruation (menarche) and menopause.The fibroid pathogenesis comprises multiple stages, starting with the recruitment of a smooth muscle stem cell from the myometrium that lacks receptors for the gonadal steroids (Bulun 2013).Under the influence of specific driver mutations, in addition to oestrogen, progesterone, and the activation of a protein named beta-catenin within a signalling pathway named wingless-type (WNT), the stem cell di erentiates into a preclinical fibroid.Subsequently, four key cell types that comprise fibroids (smooth muscle cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts and fibroid-associated fibroblasts) (Holdsworth-Carson 2014) and the extracellular matrix synergize with environmental and molecular stimuli to undergo growth acceleration and progression into clinical disease (Stewart 2016) . There are a number of potential uterine-sparing interventions for uterine fibroids.Choice of a particular intervention will be dependent upon the chief complaint, i.e.: heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pain, bulk symptoms, infertility or a combination of symptoms.The following interventions have been studied with regard to their e ect on treating uterine fibroids (in alphabetical order). Surgical interventions and most of the medical treatments aim both to control heavy menstrual bleeding and to improve bulk symptoms.The mechanisms of the control of heavy menstrual bleeding are not well understood but may include physical normalization of the endometrial cavity, or may be related to control of angiogenic factors (Stewart 1996) .Likewise, bulk symptoms have historically been thought to require volume reduction, and minimally invasive techniques such as uterine artery embolization have brought improvements to quality of life (Keung 2018) .More invasive procedures may present more adverse e ects.Recently, a selective progesterone receptor modulator (ulipristal acetate) has been extensively studied with regard to relieving moderate to severe symptoms in women with uterine fibroids (Garnock-Jones 2017), however the endometrial safety for extended treatment needs further investigation (De Milliano 2017) . There are now many systematic reviews of interventions available on the medical and surgical treatment of uterine fibroids for improving heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pain, bulk symptoms or infertility (or a combination of these).In the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, there are 13 systematic reviews available on these topics.It is important to bring these documents together into one coherent review that can be used by clinicians, policy makers and women with fibroids when making decisions about optimal treatment based on the available evidence about uterine fibroids. The objective is to summarize evidence from Cochrane Reviews on the e ectiveness and safety of treatment options available to premenopausal women with uterine fibroid-associated symptoms. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Only Cochrane Reviews, protocols and titles will be considered for inclusion in this overview.At the time of writing, systematic reviews on the following topics have been published with regard to uterine fibroids (in alphabetical order).We will list in an additional table any titles or protocols that we identify during our searches, and will incorporate data from these in future versions of the overview. We will include premenopausal, symptomatic women with a clinical or imaging diagnosis (or both) of uterine fibroids, who have sought medical attention for heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pain or bulk symptoms (or a combination of these) or for infertility (regardless of symptoms). Medical, complementary therapies or surgical interventions will be considered.Medical treatment can be used as a single intervention or administered before or a er surgery, or both.Eligible comparators include placebo or another treatment. Whilst pelvic pain/bulk symptoms secondary to uterine fibroids might not have been as extensively investigated as those for heavy menstrual bleeding, it is expected that some participants would have presented with both symptoms and it is important to seek the interventions for this specific outcome.Medical/complementary therapies or surgical interventions will be considered in all reviews. Medical or surgical interventions will be included for this variable. Primary outcome measure: improvement, measured by self-report (qualitative measures such as symptom-free, better, the same or worse) or by use of a health-related quality-of-life instrument.One of the quality-of-life measurements mostly used for uterine fibroids is the use of standardized, validated, specific questionnaires such as the UFS-QOL tool (Spies 2002) for measuring improvement of patients a er being treated.Other generic questionnaires (e.g. SF-36 -McHorney 1993) could also be used.Measurement by haemoglobin, haematocrit and ferritin levels, reduction in PBAC (pictorial blood assessment chart) scores and reduction in the number of bleeding episodes (by number of pads/day) will also be investigated. Primary outcome measure: improvement, measured by self-report (yes/no, Likert scales or numeric scales) or by use of a healthrelated quality-of-life instrument or by a quantitative instrument, such as a visual analogue scale (VAS), or improvement with a specific questionnaire such as UFSQOL. Primary outcome measures: bloating, pelvic pressure/discomfort, constipation, frequent urination, pain during intercourse measured by qualitative measures (yes/no, or Likert scales). Reduction in fibroid volume or uterine volume, measured by pelvic ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging; presence of adverse e ects secondary to treatment (vasomotor symptoms, bone density, laboratorial changes, acne, weight gain, bloating, breast tenderness, headache, nausea); recurrence rate. Primary outcome measures: live birth (number of live births per woman); clinical pregnancies (pregnancy diagnosed by ultrasound visualization of one or more gestational sacs or definitive clinical signs of pregnancy); ongoing pregnancies (pregnancy progressing beyond 12 weeks of gestation). Secondary outcome: miscarriage (spontaneous loss of a clinical pregnancy before 20 weeks of gestation or less than 400 g of fetal weight). The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews will be searched using the keyword \"uterine fibroids\" (leiomyoma is not a term that is used in this database).The term will be restricted to title, abstract or keywords.No other databases will be searched. Cochrane Reviews addressing treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding, bulk symptoms or for infertility associated with uterine fibroids will be identified by one overview author (SOC) and checked by a second overview author (LGOB).Any disagreement will be resolved by consensus or discussion with a third party (WPM). Data will be extracted independently by two overview authors (LGOB, SOC) using an Excel spreadsheet.We will follow the LGOB: none known ES: Dr Stewart reports the following: has received consulting fees from Bayer, AbbVie, Allergan and Myovant and serves on a steering committee for a fibroid trial for Myovant.She also received payment for developing an educational presentation from Med Learning Group, receives royalties from UpToDate, and has a patent ( 6440445\\n\\n==================================================\\n\\nFile: Bromley_et_al-2023-Cochrane_Database_of_Systematic_Reviews.grobid.tei.json\\nTitle: Monotherapy treatment of epilepsy in pregnancy: congenital malformation outcomes in the child\\nAuthors: Rebecca [] Bromley, Naghme [] Adab, Matt [] Bluett-Duncan, Jill [] Clayton-Smith, Jakob [] Christensen, Katherine [] Edwards, Janette [] Greenhalgh, Ruaraidh [\\'A\\'] Hill, Cerian [\\'F\\'] Jackson, Sonia [] Khanom, Ronan [\\'N\\'] Mcginty, Catrin [] Tudur Smith, Jennifer [] Pulman, Anthony [\\'G\\'] Marson\\nAbstract: \\nBody Text: Prenatal exposure to certain anti-seizure medications (ASMs) is associated with an increased risk of major congenital malformations (MCM).The majority of women with epilepsy continue taking ASMs throughout pregnancy and, therefore, information on the potential risks associated with ASM treatment is required. To assess the e ects of prenatal exposure to ASMs on the prevalence of MCM in the child. For the latest update of this review, we searched the following databases on 17 February 2022: Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to February 16, 2022) , SCOPUS (1823 onwards), and ClinicalTrials.gov,WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP).No language restrictions were imposed. We included prospective cohort controlled studies, cohort studies set within pregnancy registries, randomised controlled trials and epidemiological studies using routine health record data.Participants were women with epilepsy taking ASMs; the two control groups were women without epilepsy and untreated women with epilepsy. ASMs readily cross the placenta from the mother into the foetusus (Brent 2004 ; Tetro 2017).Prospective observational studies (e.g.Milan Study 1999), registry-based studies (e.g.Tomson 2011), case-control studies (Jentink 2010a) , and epidemiological studies using datasets of routine health records (e.g.Denmark Health Record Registers) provide evidence of an association between ASM treatment and an increased prevalence of major congential malformations.The level of risk varies for di erent types of ASM, with first trimester valproate (VPA) exposure associated with the largest increase in prevalence (EURAP 2018; Meador 2006; Milan Study 1999; North American Epilepsy and Pregnancy Register; UK and Ireland Epilepsy and Pregnancy Register).The mechanisms through which prenatal exposure to ASMs are associated with an increased prevalence of major malformations likely di ers by treatment type and may be multifactorial.This review investigates the outcomes for monotherapy treatment with di erent ASMs to identify currently available evidence on which to base treatment decisions. The decision to continue ASM treatment during pregnancy requires taking a risk-benefit decision.On the one hand, there is the potential risk posed to the foetus when the medication is a teratogen yet on the other hand, there is the health and well-being of the mother, who requires treatment throughout her pregnancy to minimise the risk of seizures (Tomson 2015); the choice of ASM depends on the type of epilepsy and the seizures (Marson 2007).A lack of knowledge regarding foetal safety limits treatment options for women with epilepsy in their childbearing years, as women and their doctors may avoid ASMs with limited data.Conversely, a lack of evidence may lead to an ASM with a higher foetal risk profile being used extensively, prior to a full understanding of its risks. While a number of studies indicate a teratogenic risk from certain ASMs, there are conflicting results regarding the degree of risk and the types of malformations associated with specific ASMs.Data are slow to accumulate and an earlier version of this review (Weston 2016) found extremely limited data on ASMs with a decade or more of clinical use.Such a lack of evidence makes it di icult to counsel women about treatment choices before or during pregnancy.There is, therefore, a clear need for a systematic review and meta-analysis of existing data to inform these decisions.Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) would provide the most reliable evidence about the e ects of ASMs in pregnancy, but are essentially precluded by ethical considerations and logistical challenges pertaining to study design, recruitment and interpretation. In view of this, we performed a systematic review of all available evidence including registry-based, prospective cohort studies, RCTs and epidemiological studies using routine health record databases.At the protocol stage, we decided not to include malformation case-control studies (e.g.Jentink 2010a; Jentink 2010b) due to the substantial di erences in the approach in these studies and how these methods compare to prospective observational cohort studies.This decision is discussed further in Overall completeness and applicability of evidence.This review is an update of two previous reviews (Adab 2004 ; Weston 2016).Evidence from this review, along with the related review by the same Cochrane team (Bromley 2014) , will aid the decisions that clinicians and women with epilepsy have to make about the treatment of epilepsy during the potential childbearing years. To assess the e ects of prenatal exposure to commonly prescribed ASMs on the prevalence of major congenital malformations in the child. This review examines the association between specific ASM exposures and the prevalence of major congenital malformations compared to the general population or unexposed pregnancies in women with epilepsy.It also compares the prevalence of specific major congenital malformations types across the ASM treatment groups. We considered the following types of studies. 1. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs).These studies included women with epilepsy who were randomised to a particular ASM prior to conception.The intervention group(s) comprised women with epilepsy taking ASM monotherapy.2. Prospective observational cohort studies.These included consecutive participants whose clinical information was collected prior to the birth of the child.The intervention group(s) comprised women with epilepsy treated with ASM monotherapy.3. Registry studies.These involve the collection of data from a wide region, country or number of countries, and recruitment is o en based on self-referral or clinician-referral, leading to nonsequential case ascertainment.We considered both diseasebased registries (e.g.pregnancy and epilepsy registries) and industry-sponsored product registry datasets.Pregnant women Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews with epilepsy prescribed ASM monotherapy were recruited prospectively prior to childbirth. 4. Population-based routine health record datasets.These studies utilise data collected for routine health monitoring, administrative or reimbursement reasons for entire national populations or specific populations (e.g.medical insurance databases).Individual recruitment of participants is not required.The intervention group(s) comprised women with epilepsy taking ASM monotherapy. Pregnant women with epilepsy taking a single ASM of interest were eligible for the intervention group. Participants eligible for the comparator groups were: • pregnant women with epilepsy taking an ASM; • pregnant women with epilepsy taking no ASM; or • pregnant women who do not have epilepsy. We excluded studies reporting ASM use solely in pregnant women with other conditions (e.g.mood disorders, pain).We included studies involving women taking ASMs for epilepsy and other conditions if the non-epilepsy conditions accounted for 30% or less of the total treatment group.This percentage criterion was increased from the previous review to accommodate data from population healthcare datasets, which o en include a wider group of participant indications. Women with epilepsy who received any of the following ASMs as monotherapy: acetazolmide, brivaracetam, bromide, carbamazepine, cenobamate, clomethiazole, clonazepam, clorazepate, diazepam, dimethyloxazolidinedione, eslicarbazepine, ethosuximide, estazolam, felbamate, flunarizine, gabapentin, lacosamide, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, lorazepam, magnesium sulphate, medazepam, methylphenobarbital, mephenytoin, meprobamate, methazolamide, methsuximide, methyloxazepam, midazolam, nimetazepam, nitrazepam, oxcarbazepine, perampanel, phenobarbitone, phenytoin, primidone, pregabalin, remacemide, retigabine, rufinamide, sodium valproate, stiripentol, sulthiame, tiagabine, topiramate, trimethadione, trifluoromethoxy benzothiazole, valnoctamide, vigabatrin, or zonisamide. We used two separate types of comparator groups in this review, as currently there is no clear evidence regarding the reliability of combining data from these two di erent groups.The two comparator groups are: • controls: women with a diagnosis of epilepsy who were not taking ASMs and women without epilepsy.• comparator treatment: women with epilepsy treated with ASM monotherapy, evaluated in subgroup analyses to enable treatment comparisons. The proportion of children who present with any type of major congenital malformation (as defined by study authors).Major malformations are structural abnormalities of the body or organs present from birth and which require intervention (e.g., corrective surgery) or have a significant level of impact on the child\\'s daily functioning (EUROCAT). The proportion of children who present with the following specific major congenital malformations by area of the body. • Neural tube malformations. • Cardiac malformations. • Oro-facial cle /craniofacial malformation. • Skeletal or limb malformations. We chose the above disorders because they are important major malformations associated with exposure to ASMs in utero, because these are the most prevalent congenital malformations in the general population (ref: https://eu-rd-platform.jrc.ec.europa.eu/eurocat/eurocat-data/prevalence_en), and because of the availability of data within the included studies.When extracting data from included studies, we compiled a list of all the specified malformations.Author JCS, a clinical geneticist, then reviewed the list and classified the items into one of the four specific malformation categories. We did not impose any language restrictions in the search and, when necessary, we obtained translations of articles written in languages other than English. We reviewed conference abstracts from neurology meetings published from 2010 to 2022, including abstracts from the International League Against Epilepsy meetings (American Epilepsy Society, International Epilepsy Congress, European Congress on Epileptology, Asian and Oceanian Epilepsy Congress and Latin American Congress on Epilepsy) and Teratology meetings (Teratology Society and European Teratology Society).Where possible, we linked abstracts to published datasets or categorised them as awaiting classification. We cross-matched reference lists of original research and review articles to the studies generated from the electronic searches. We handsearched reference lists of recent review articles and contacted lead and corresponding authors in the area for any relevant unpublished material. Five authors (RB, JW, JG, KE, RMcG) reviewed the titles and abstracts of articles highlighted by the searches and removed studies that obviously did not meet the inclusion criteria.Four authors (RB, JW, KE, RMcG) used full-text reports to determine study eligibility.We discussed disagreements and sought the opinion of a third author (JG, CJ, RB), when necessary.Multiple reports from single studies are common in this field.To ensure that each cohort was represented only once in our analysis, therefore to avoid double-counting the population across papers of included studies, we linked studies by recruitment date and sought confirmation from authors whether reports referred to single study populations.Where this was unclear, we contacted study authors for clarification. Eight authors (RB, JW, NA, JG, AM, KE, RMcG, SK, CJ) undertook data extraction of the included studies.We used pre-standardised electronic data extraction forms that members of the review team piloted and then amended, where necessary.We then crosschecked data extraction.All entries into RevMan were also doublechecked. Due to the observational design of the majority of the studies, we utilised the Risk Of Bias In Non-Randomized Studiesof Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool which the Cochrane Non-Randomised Studies Methods Group has developed (Sterne 2016).The ROBINS-I tool for assessing risk of bias examines bias in the domains of confounding, selection, treatment classification, missing data, measurement and reported results.ROBINS-I uses signalling questions on a four-point scale to determine level of bias in specific elements of biases for each of these domains.Overall domain bias ratings are then classed as low, moderate, serious, critical or no information. ROBINS-I was developed for treatment studies and not pharmacovigilance studies, where the person taking the medication (the mother) is not the same person in which the outcome can occur (the child).Therefore, ROBINS-I needed to be adapted for use in this review.The adaption was led by author RB with input from other authors.Important confounder and mediator variables were selected based on published evidence of an association both in the general population and specifically in investigations regarding in utero ASM exposure and congential malformation outcomes.See Appendix 6 for further information. Eight authors completed risk of bias ratings (RB, JW, NA, JG, AM, KE, SK, MBD).Each included study was reviewed by two independent raters and the opinion of a third author (RB) was sought where there were disagreements in the domain level ratings.For RCTs, we intended to use the original Cochrane tool for assessing risk of bias (RoB1) (Higgins 2011 ). We intended, where applicable, to create Summary of findings tables for outcomes and to grade each outcome accordingly using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach (Guyatt 2008 ).However, we found GRADE to not be optimised for these types of data and using it would have led to di erential ratings across comparisons, depending on whether there was a di erence in MCM rate or not; thus, producing ratings of lower evidence confidence for comparisons with no di erence between the ASMs.Further work is required on GRADE and ROBINS-I to optimise them for pregnancy pharmacovigilance investigations. We considered that di erent study design types or comparator groups may lead to di erent outcome results and, therefore, we did not combine all data into a single meta-analysis containing mixed study types, groups of di erent ASMs and comparator groups.Meta-analyses were instead stratified by study type, by comparator group (e.g.women with epilepsy untreated and women without epilepsy and with no treatment), and by ASM versus ASM comparison.We computed pooled prevalences of malformations within AED (antiepileptic drug) groups (using fixede ect models, unless otherwise stated) and reported them at the beginning of each drug section.The primary and secondary outcomes are presented as risk ratios (RRs).We also computed risk di erences (RDs) using Review Manager (RevMan) to take into account studies with no reported events.We calculated these e ect estimates in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and reported them in the results section (Higgins 2011) .Where treatment e ects were reported from individual studies, we used the summary e ect measure that had been utilised by the study authors to report results from the study.In some cases, OR instead of RR was reported by individual study authors. The RR is a measure of relative e ect expressed as the ratio of the risk of an event in the two groups.If the 95% confidence interval includes the value of 1.00, this implies there is no di erence between the groups (i.e. a non-significant result).If the value of 1.00 lies outside the 95% confidence interval, this implies there is a di erence between the groups (i.e. a significant result).The RD is a measure of absolute e ect expressed as the di erence of the risk of an event in the two groups.If the 95% confidence interval contains the value of 0.00, this implies there is no di erence between the groups (i.e. both groups have the same risk).If the value of 0.00 lies outside the 95% confidence interval, this implies there is a di erence between the groups (i.e. a significant result). Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. The significance of the RR and RD may be di erent, as the RD takes into account comparisons where there were no events in either arm, whilst the other does not.Although the RR estimates are large in many comparisons, the corresponding risk di erence estimates are fairly small; but even a small increase in risk for a specific major malformation is clinically meaningful.In these cases, it would be up to the patient/clinician to interpret these risk estimates in the context of the adverse outcome and in relation to the potential benefits of treatment (e.g.seizure control).We did not account for multiple testing and the totality of the evidence for a particular exposure should be considered rather than the outcomes of a single comparison.Finally, we did not carry out any formal analysis of a dose-response relationship.We have taken any dose-response results reported directly from the study papers. Data published in studies are o en duplicated as they are updated, particularly in the case of the prospective pregnancy registries, which update their publications as the numbers of enrolled pregnancies increase.In such cases, we considered the latest time point as the \\'primary\\' study for inclusion.In some cohorts, this meant that we used di erent publications for di erent ASMs.Further, there are studies that report combined data from a number of di erent registers (e.g.EURAP 2018; Samren 1997) which also report independently and routine health record studies with cohort overlap (e.g.UK Clinical Research Practice Database; UK Health Record THIN Register).Where the combined data reported provided greater numbers for a particular ASM comparison, it was included in the meta-analysis but, where individual initiatives had greater numbers for a specific comparison (e.g.ASM vs control group), we included the individual study data and provided a narrative report of the collaborative initiatives.We carefully examined data to ensure that we did not include them more than once in the analysis and that we did not omit any non-duplicated data. We contacted study authors to obtain missing statistics from included studies to input into the meta-analysis.We also investigated study reasons for missing data to determine if they were missing at random or not. We assessed clinical heterogeneity by examining the di erences in study characteristics in order to inform decisions regarding the combination of study data in meta-analysis.A priori hypotheses of sources of clinical heterogeneity included: type of population (regional, national or international, single or multicentre), loss to follow-up, maternal factors including age, duration of ASM treatment, family history of congenital malformation, lifestyle factors, monotherapy, socioeconomic status, type of epilepsy, use of other medications and years of education.Child factors included: age of assessment, sex, seizure exposure, length of follow-up and outcome measurement. Where applicable, we also assessed statistical heterogeneity by examining the I 2 statistic and a Chi 2 test, using the guidelines outlined in Higgins 2011 for interpreting the results.According to these guidelines, an I 2 statistic of 0% to 40% may not be important, 30% to 60% may indicate moderate heterogeneity, 50% to 90% may indicate substantial heterogeneity and 75% to 100% may indicate considerable heterogeneity.Therefore, for this review, we considered an I 2 statistic of more than 50% to indicate significant heterogeneity.The I 2 statistic was not applicable in comparisons where there was only a single study or when only one study contributed data to the analysis.When interpreting the Chi 2 test, a P value of less than 0.01 was considered to indicate significant heterogeneity.When we found statistical heterogeneity, we presented both fixed-e ect and random-e ects analyses to enable exploration of di erences. We included studies using the Outcome Reporting Bias in Trials (ORBIT) classification system if we suspected selective outcome reporting bias.We requested all protocols from included study authors to enable comparison of outcomes of interest; however, we received very few responses, complicating our performance of this comparison. Our comprehensive search of multiple sources and data types, together with our requests for unpublished data or clarification from authors, minimised the risk of publication bias. We employed both fixed-e ect and random-e ects meta-analyses to synthesise the data.We presented the primary outcome (major congenital malformations) and the secondary outcome of specific malformations as a risk ratio (RR).Within certain comparisons, we have also presented the risk di erences (RD) for both primary outcome (overall malformation rate).In the event that we deemed meta-analysing inappropriate (e.g.presence of clinical heterogeneity), we applied a narrative form to the review, discussing all comparisons according to the findings presented within the studies. Comparisons carried out included: 1. specific ASM monotherapy group versus controls on major congenital malformations; 2. specific ASM monotherapy group versus controls on specific major congential malformation types; 3. specific ASM monotherapy group versus specific ASM monotherapy group on major congential malformations; 4. specific ASM monotherapy group versus specific ASM monotherapy group on specific major congential malformations. We stratified each comparison by control group, comparator group and study design to ensure appropriate combination of study data.For example, cases reported in a national pregnancy and epilepsy register may also be represented in epidemiological datasets of routine health data which covers the same region or a case in an administrative insurance database may also have been reported to a national epilepsy and pregnancy register and therefore data were not combined across these di erent data sources. Subgroup analysis was stratified by ASM and type of control or comparator group.When heterogeneity was present across outcomes, we carried out a random-e ects analysis.We examined di erences between analyses and reported the appropriate analysis. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. We adopted a cautious approach to combining data extracted from di erent types of study, and also where di erent comparator groups were included as outlined in Measures of treatment e ect.Additionally, we only included studies where over 70% of the cohort were women taking ASMs for the treatment of epilepsy.This was due to the heterogeneity around doses prescribed, across women taking ASMs for di erent conditions.This decision is supported by the findings of Hernandez Diaz and colleagues (US Medicaid Registers) who found that di erences in the dose of topiramate prescribed for women with epilepsy compared to women prescribed it for other conditions altered the risk of orofacial anomalies. In this review, we considered ASM use in during pregnancy in women with epilepsy and the major malformation rate in their exposed children (Figure 1 ).Comparisons were made across the di erent ASM treatments and to unexposed children.The outcomes are summarised in Table 1 along with Summary of findings 1, Summary of findings 2 for lamotrigine and levetiracetam and in Table 2 , Table 3 , Table 4 , and Table 5 for carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, topiramate and valproate, respectively.The data for other ASMs were too limited at this time for useful tables to be compiled.Relative risks and risk di erences are displayed in Table 6  The Robins-I was adapted for use here to understand the risk of biases but is not yet optimised for pregnancy pharmacovigilance work and, therefore, caution is required in the interpretation of its ratings.It did, however, show that di erent methodological approaches have di erent patterns of biases and are therefore in part complimentary (Figure 2 ).Cohort studies with primary data collection, for example, tend to have lower risks of misclassification of treatment and standardised review of the congenital malformation outcome in the children (leading to low risk of bias ratings), yet they are at higher risk of bias for cohort selection.The use of routine health record data at a national population level does not have these selection risks, however.Stratification of the results by study type provides an internal validation for the results (Figure 3 ) and the evidence presented in this review should be considered more certain when the results of di erent comparisons are consistent across study types. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Malformations are rare outcomes and therefore larger groups are needed to reliably detect a higher risk of malformation in one group over another.Therefore, the certainty of the evidence is greater for medications such as VPA, carbamazepine (CBZ) and lamotrigine (LTG) where the numbers of children are higher within and across the comparisons.The available data were more moderate for levetiracetam (LEV), phenytoin (PHT) and phenobarbital (PB) in certain comparisons.Care should be taken in the interpretation of comparisons where there were fewer than 1000 pregnancies. In this updated review, electronic searches identified 1067 additional publications; this was in addition to the 11,695 records previously detected in searches for an earlier version of this review (Weston 2016 ).We found two additional records through handsearching.Following the removal of duplicates, 12,296 abstracts were screened for inclusion in the review across the original and this update.We excluded 12,013 abstracts due to irrelevance, leaving 283 full texts (156 new for this update) to be assessed for eligibility.As the inclusion criteria had been extended to include studies using routine health records in this update, we re-evaluated search results from the last version for such studies and identified eight additional studies (14 papers).In total, we excluded 155 full-text papers where they did not meet the inclusion criteria.See Characteristics of excluded studies and Figure 1 for the study flow diagram.We ultimately included 49 studies (128 publications) in this review.Of these, 113 records and 45 studies contributed data to the meta-analyses, two studies had certain data included in the meta-analysis whilst other data were narratively reviewed. A total of 128 included full-text publications reported on the 49 independent studies included in this review, of which all but one were non-randomised studies.The high number of publications per study were from longitudinal research initiatives such as epilepsy and pregnancy registers which update their results periodically.These full texts were related to an included study, as they presented information on the same cohort of children but either at a di erent time point or on a related, but not included, outcome (i.e.obstetric or neurodevelopmental outcome).Reported outcomes for each ASM were taken from the most relevant publication within a series; therefore, malformation information for specific ASMs may come from di erent publications within a series. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. We excluded 42 studies (55 papers) from the review (Excluded studies).Several of these papers were not written in the English language and, therefore, were sent for translation and data extraction in order to determine the study design and methodology used.The most frequent reasons for exclusion, however, were absence of reported ASM monotherapy-specific malformation outcomes, retrospective study design, and case-control study design.Studies were also excluded where the maternal indication was not epilepsy in 70% or more of participants, or if a subgroup analysis was not provided for women with epilepsy indication.These decisions were made to limit the likely heterogeneity regarding doses of ASMs used across indications, as dose is a significant driver of higher malformation risk (Brent 2004 ). Robins-I ratings are displayed in Figure 2 . For bias in confounding, no studies were rated as low as no studies were comparable to a randomised controlled trial. For bias in selection, three studies were rated as low (Denmark Health Record Registers, Finland Health Record Registers, Norwegian Health Record Registers) as they represented national datasets and one study was rated as moderate (Sweden Health Record Registers).All cohort or pregnancy register studies were at risk of selection biases and therefore 37 studies were rated as serious (  For bias in classification, 14 studies were rated as low (  This domain was di icult to assess as, for most of the studies, no protocol was available (particularly for older studies) or contact with the authors could not be established (  See: Summary of findings 1 Summary of findings -Lamotrigine; Summary of findings 2 Summary of findings -Levetiracetam Each included comparison is reviewed below with both the meta-analysis results being reported alongside any studies which required narrative review only.In comparisons where there were less than 50 children in both groups, the meta-analysis is not reported, but the data is summarised narratively.Summary tables displaying the pooled prevalences, RR and RDs for each comparison are available in Table 1 along with Summary of findings 1 for lamotrigine; Summary of findings 2 for levetiracetam, Table 2 for carbamazepine, Table 3 for oxcarbazepine, Table 4 for topiramate, and Table 5 for valproate.A complete summary of all included ASM pooled prevalences, RR and RDs can be found in Table 1 , Table 6 , and Table 7 , respectively with a visual presentation of the major malformation rates displayed in Figure 3 . The prevalence of major malformations (any type) in the cohort studies for children of women without epilepsy (N = 3537), based on data from 12 studies, was 2.1% (95% CI 1.5 to 3.0).The prevalence of major malformations in routine health record studies for children of women without epilepsy (N = 373,028), based on data from three studies, was 3.3% (95% CI 1.5 to 7.1). The prevalence of major malformations (any type) in the cohort studies for children of women with epilepsy (no medication) (N = 1708), based on data from 21 studies, was 3.0% (95% CI 2.1 to 4.2).The prevalence of major malformations in routine health record studies for children of women with epilepsy (no medication) (N = 11,286), based on data from three studies, was 3.2% (95% CI 1.7 to 6.1). The prevalence of major malformations (any type) in the cohort studies for children exposed to carbamazepine (CBZ) (N = 5415), based on data from 37 studies, was 4.7% (95% CI 3.7 to 5.9).The prevalence of major malformations in routine health record studies for children exposed to CBZ (N = 2806), based on data from five studies, was 4.0% (95% CI 2.9 to 5.4). 1.1 All major malformations Pooled results from 13 cohort studies suggested an increased risk with CBZ (RR 2.30, 95% CI 1.47 to 3.59; I 2 = 0%), with children exposed to CBZ (N = 1448) experiencing more major malformations than control children (N = 3599) (Analysis 1.1).The RD also suggested a higher absolute risk (RD 0.02, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.03; I 2 = 0%) (Analysis 1.1). The multicentre study, Samren 1997, reported 22 (8%) cases of major malformations from 280 infants exposed to CBZ.However, the numbers from centres with a control group were smaller, with four cases of malformation out of just 14 exposed infants.This suggested an increased risk relative to the control children born to women without epilepsy (RR 4.9, 95% CI 1.3 to 18.0). Pooled findings from 20 cohort studies suggested an increased risk with CBZ (RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.96; I 2 = 0%), with children exposed to CBZ (N = 3598) experiencing more major malformations than control children (N = 1691) (Analysis 1.1).The RD also suggested an increased risk with CBZ (RD 0.01, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.02; I 2 = 1%) (Analysis 1.1). Results from two routine health record studies suggested no evidence of a di erence in risk (RR 1.14 95% CI 0.80 to 1.64; I 2 = 0%), with children exposed to CBZ (N = 983) experiencing a similar major malformation rate to control children (N = 372,111) (Analysis 1.1).

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Pooled results from four routine health record studies suggested an increased risk with CBZ (RR 1.42 95% CI 1.10 to 1.83; I 2 = 0%), with children exposed to CBZ (N = 2116) experiencing more major malformations than control children (N = 12,218) (Analysis 1.1).The RD suggested an increased level of risk for CBZ (RD 0.01, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.02; I 2 = 0%) (Analysis 1.1). Pooled results from seven cohort studies suggested no evidence of a di erence in risk (RR 3.09, 95% CI 0.38 to 25.40;I 2 = 0%), with no di erence in the number of neural tube malformations in children exposed to CBZ (N = 269) and compared to control children (N = 1801) (Analysis 1.2).The RD also suggested no di erence in the level of risk (RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.02; I 2 = 0%) (Analysis 1.2).

Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. The EURAP 2018 collaboration has reported on the largest uniformly assessed group of children exposed to CBZ (N = 1957). They reported a higher malformation rate with higher doses of CBZ.Doses =/< 700 mg/d were found to have a malformation risk of 4.5% (95% CI 3.5% to 5.8%), whilst dose > 700 mg/d were associated with a prevalence of 7.2%, (95% CI 5.4 to 9.4); a di erence which suggested a dose association (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.37, P = 0.0352).When compared to children exposed to =/< 325 mg/d of LTG, the prevalence was higher for doses =/< 700 mg/d (OR 1.71 95% CI 1.12 to 2.61, P = 0.0143), and doses over 700 mg/d were also higher (OR 2.68, 95% CI 1.71 to 4.19, P = 0.0002).In contrast, however, the North American Epilepsy and Pregnancy Register (N = 1033) failed to document an association between the risk of major malformation and the dose of CBZ; however, this group was smaller.The Australian Epilepsy and Pregnancy Register, the UK and Ireland Epilepsy and Pregnancy Register, and a number of smaller studies also did not identify a dose e ect (Kaaja 2003; Kaneko 1999; Milan Study 1999; Motherisk Registry; Samren 1997). Data regarding the impact of dose are limited from routine healthcare record-based studies.Data analyses from Finland Health Record Registers did not establish a dose relationship, however, the number of carbamazepine monotherapy cases was small (N = 32).Results from the Norwegian Health Record Registers and Sweden Health Record Registers did not capture ASM doses, and researchers using the UK Health Record THIN Register or the UK Clinical Research Practice Database were not able to access dose information.Dose data have not currently been provided by the Denmark Health Record Registers for CBZ dose. The prevalence of major malformations (any type) in cohort studies for children exposed to clonazepam (CZP) (N = 95), based on data from four studies, was 2.1% (95% CI 0.2 to 17.3).The prevalence of major malformations in routine health record studies for children exposed to CZP (N = 161), based on data from one study, was 2.5% (95% CI 0.0 to 131.8). Pooled results from two cohort studies suggested no evidence of a di erence in risk (RR 2.76, 95% CI 0.55 to 13.94;I 2 = 0%), with children exposed to CZP (N = 65) experiencing comparable rates of major malformations to control children (N = 504) (Analysis 2.1). The RD also suggested no di erence in the level of risk (RD 0.02, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.07; I 2 = 0%) (Analysis 2.1). Pooled findings from three cohort studies suggested no evidence of a di erence in risk (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.21 to 5.42; I 2 = 0%), with children exposed to CZP (N = 31) experiencing comparable rates of major malformations to control children (N = 524) (Analysis 2.1). The RD also suggested no di erence in the level of risk (RD -0.03, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.04; I 2 = 0%) (Analysis 2.1). One study suggested no evidence of a di erence in risk (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.18 to 2.77; I 2 = NA (not available)) with children exposed to CZP (N = 113) experiencing comparable rates of major malformations to control children (N = 369,267).The RD also suggested no di erence in the level of risk (RD -0.01, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.02; I 2 = NA) (Analysis 2.1). One study suggested no evidence of a di erence in risk (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.17 to 2.79; I 2 = NA) with children exposed to CZP (N = 113) experiencing comparable rates of major malformations to control children (N = 1900).The RD also suggested no di erence in the level of risk (RD -0.01, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.02; I 2 = NA) (Analysis 2.1). Specific malformation types were not reviewed due to the small amount of data. There is too little experience with CZP in pregnancy to be able to report on the potential of an association between the dose of CZP and MCM risk. The prevalence of major malformations (any type) in cohort studies for children exposed to gabapentin (GBP) (N = 192) based on data from four studies was 2.0% (95% CI 0.1 to 32.2).The prevalence of major malformations in routine health record studies for children exposed to GBP (N = 18), was based on data from one study and therefore could not be calculated. Pooled results from two cohort studies suggested no evidence of a di erence in risk of major malformations for the children exposed to gabapentin (N = 147) in comparison to children born to women without epilepsy (N = 570) (RR 1.78, 95% CI 0.50 to -6.29, P = 0.37, I 2 = 89%), but there was heterogeneity in the results (Analysis 3.1).A random-e ects RR was calculated which also suggested a comparable level of risk (RR 8.04, 95% CI 0.03 to 1898.73,P = 0.45, I 2 = 89%).The RD also suggested no di erence in the level of risk (RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.03; I 2 = 75%).Due to heterogeneity, a random-e ects RD was calculated which also found a comparable level of risk (RD 0.19, 95% CI -0.37 to 0.74, P = 0.51, I 2 = 75%) (Analysis 3.1). Pooled results from two cohort studies suggested no evidence of a di erence in risk of major malformation for the children exposed to gabapentin (n=47) in comparison to control children (n= 721) (RR 1.77, 95% CI 0.46 to 6.90, P = 0.41, I 2 = 0% (Analysis 3.1). Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews There were no studies that provided data for this comparison in a format that could be combined in a meta-analysis.However, Patorno and colleagues (US Medicaid Registers) conducted a sensitivity analysis that was restricted to epilepsy indications and included 347 pregnancies exposed to gabapentin in comparison to an unexposed reference group of 11,861 pregnancies.There was no reported di erence in the malformation outcome either in the epilepsy subgroup (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.73 to 2.71, P = 0.31) or in the main analysis which included 3745 gabapentin-exposed children (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.21, P = 0.33). There were no studies that provided data for this comparison. We were unable to estimate a RR for the included study due to there being no reported neural tube malformations in children exposed to GBP (N = 2) or control children (N = 128) (Analysis 3.2). There were no studies that provided data for this comparison. There were no studies that provided data for this comparison. There were no studies that provided data for this comparison. Data from one study suggested a di erence in risk (RR 129.00, 95% CI 6.49 to 2562.48,I 2 = NA) with children exposed to GBP (N = 2) being at higher risk than control children (N = 128) (Analysis 3.3).However, the RD suggested no di erence in the level of risk (RD 0.50, 95% CI -0.07 to 1.07; I 2 = NA) Included studies did not reach the threshold for reporting in the meta-analysis (Analysis 3.3).However, available data showed that there was one case of cardiac malformation in children exposed to GBP (N = 2) in comparison to zero cases in the control children (N = 4), based on data from one study (Miskov 2016). Patorno and colleagues, using data including the US Medicaid Registers, found a comparable level of risk for cardiac anomalies in children exposed to gabapentin (N = 347) versus children born to women without epilepsy (N = 11,861) (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.73 to 2.71, P = 0.31). There were no studies that provided data for this comparison. We were unable to estimate a RR from one study due to there being no oro-facial cle / craniofacial malformations in children exposed to GBP (n=2) in comparison to no cases in 128 control children (Analysis 3.4). There were no studies that provided data for this comparison. There were no studies that provided data for this comparison. There were no studies that provided data for this comparison. We were unable to estimate a RR from one study due to there being no reported skeletal/limb malformations in children exposed to GBP (n=2) or 128 control children, based on data from one study (Analysis 3.5). There were no studies that provided data for this comparison. There were no studies that provided data for this comparison. There were no studies that provided data for this comparison. The investigation of GBP dose and its potential association with an increased rate of malformations is limited due to the relatively small number of pregnancies where data are currently available. The US Medicaid Registers is the most reliable data source currently available.The study authors did not find that malformation risk increased with dose according to tertiles of the first and the highest prescribed daily dose filled.Doses of 600 mg/d through to 900 mg/d (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.24, P = 0.98) or doses above 900 mg/d (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.44, P = 0.15) were not associated with a risk above the baseline risk.The largest cohort study of GBP-exposed pregnancies was from the North American Epilepsy and Pregnancy Register (N = 145) and no association between increasing dose and increased malformation risk was identified in this study.The participant numbers in other included studies of GBP were too small to investigate any e ect of dose size and MCM risk. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. The prevalence of major malformations (any type) in cohort studies for children exposed to levetiracetam (LEV) (N = 1242), based on data from 11 studies, was 2.6% (95% CI 1.6 to 4.4).The prevalence of major malformations in routine health record studies for children exposed to LEV (N = 248), based on data from two studies, was 2.8% (95% CI 0.0 to 321.9).Pooled results from four cohort studies suggested no evidence of a di erence in risk (RR 2.20, 95% CI 0.98 to 4.93; I 2 = 0%), with children exposed to LEV (N = 574) experiencing comparable rates of major malformations to control children (N = 1022) (Analysis 4.1).The RD also suggested no di erence in the level of risk (RD 0.01, 95% CI -0.00 to 0.03; I 2 = 0%). Pooled results from six cohort studies suggested no evidence of a di erence in risk (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.28; I 2 = 0%), with children exposed to LEV (N = 724) experiencing comparable rates of major malformations to control children (N = 1101) (Analysis 4.1).The RD also suggested no di erence in the level of risk (RD -0.01, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.00; I 2 = 0%).

Pooled results from two routine health record studies suggested no evidence of a di erence in risk (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.71; I 2 = 0%), with children exposed to LEV (N = 248) experiencing comparable rates of major malformations to control children (N = 10,377) (Analysis 4.1).The RD also suggested no di erence in the level of risk (RD -0.01, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.01; I 2 = 0%). We were unable to estimate a RR from two studies due to there being no reported cases of neural tube malformation in children exposed to LEV (N = 105) or control children (N = 383) (Analysis 4.2). Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews We were unable to estimate a RR from two studies due to there being no skeletal / limb malformations in children exposed to LEV (N = 105) or control children (N = 383) (Analysis 4.5). Pooled results from three studies suggested no evidence of a di erence in risk (RR 3.21, 95% CI 0.46 to 22.50; I 2 = NA), with children exposed to LEV (N = 272) experiencing comparable rates of skeletal/limb malformations to control children (N = 376) (Analysis 4.5).The RD also suggested no di erence in the level of risk (RD 0.01, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.03; I 2 = 0%). No included studies reported data on this outcome. No included studies reported data for this outcome. EURAP 2018 had the largest cohort of LEV-exposed children to conduct dose investigations in 599 exposed children.Whilst they did not make comparisons between di erent levels of LEV dose directly, they did report that there was evidence of lower risk of any LEV dose (250-4000 mg/d) in comparison to doses of VPA </= 650 mg/d and dose of CBZ > 700 mg/d, whilst there was no evidence of di erence in comparison to doses of LTG either at </= 325 mg/d or > 325 mg/d, or in comparison to OXC at doses ranging from 75-4500 mg/d.Additionally, the North American Epilepsy and Pregnancy Register reporting on LEV-exposed children (N = 450), the UK and Ireland Epilepsy and Pregnancy Register (N = 304), the Australian Epilepsy and Pregnancy Register (N = 139), the Kerala Epilepsy and Pregnancy Registry (N = 106) and the MONEAD 2020 study (N = 99) also failed to find an association between increasing doses of LEV and congenital anomaly risk; however, group sizes may still be too limited at higher dose levels to detect increased levels of MCM risk. The prevalence of major malformations (any type) in cohort studies for children exposed to lamotrigine (LTG) (N = 4704), based on data from 15 studies, was 2.7% (95% CI 1.9 to 3.8).The prevalence of major malformations in routine health record studies for children exposed to LTG (N = 2502), based on data from four studies, was 3.5% (95% CI 2.5 to 4.9). Pooled results from seven studies suggested an increased risk with LTG (RR 1.97, 95% CI 1.16 to 3.39; I 2 = 0%), with children exposed to LTG (N = 1899) experiencing more major malformations to control children (N = 2693) (Analysis 5.1).The RD also suggested a higher risk (RD 0.01, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.03; I 2 = 0%). Pooled results from eight studies suggested no evidence of a di erence in risk (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.63; I 2 = 0%), with children exposed to LTG (N = 2767) experiencing comparable rates of major malformations to control children (N = 1151) (Analysis 5.1).The RD also suggested no di erence in the level of risk (RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.01; I 2 = 0%).

The EURAP 2018 collaboration has reported on a large, uniformly assessed, group of children exposed to LTG (N = 2514).It reported a higher MCM rate with higher doses of LTG.Doses =/< 325 mg/d were found to have an MCM risk of 2.5% (95% CI 1.8% to 3.3%), whilst doses > 325 mg/d were associated with MCM in 4.3% of children (95% CI 2.9% to 6.2%); a di erence which suggested a dose association (OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.80, P = 0.0463). When EURAP 2018 compared lower dose LTG (=/< 325 mg/d) to other monotherapy ASMs, they found evidence suggesting a lower MCM risk in comparison to CBZ at =/< 700 mg/d (OR 1.71 95% CI 1.12 to 2.61, P = 0.0143) and lower risk than CBZ doses > 700 mg/d (OR 2.68, 95% CI 1.71 to 4.19, P = 0.0002).In comparison to LEV, there was no evidence of a di erence between lower doses of LTG (</= 325 mg/d) and LEV doses between =/> 250-4000 mg/d (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.62 to 2.00, P = 0.7282).Comparisons to VPA demonstrated lower MCM risks for lower LTG dose (=/< 325 mg/d) in comparison to VPA doses at =/< 650 mg/d (OR 2.70, 95% CI 1.67 to 4.38, P = 0.0002), > 650 mg/d to =/< 1450 mg/d (OR 4.72, 95% CI 3.11 to 7.18, P < 0.0002), or at doses of VPA > 1450 mg/d (OR 13.52, 95% CI 7.73 to 23.64, P = 0.0002).Exposure to LTG at a dose =/< 325 mg daily was associated with a lower MCM risk than PB exposure at doses of between > 80 and =/< 130 mg/d (OR 2.46, 95% CI 1.16 to 5.23, P = 0.0196) and at PB doses > 130 mg/d (OR 5.81, 95% CI 2.40 to 14.08, P = 0.0002).There was, however, no evidence of a di erence in comparison of LTG doses =/< 325 mg/d to the lowest investigated PB dose of =/ < 80 mg/d (OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.25 to 4.60, P = 0.923).Rates of PHT, TPM, and OXC-exposed pregnancies were lower in the EURAP study which should be considered with regard to findings suggesting that there is no dose association here.In comparison to lower dose LTG (=/< 325 mg/d), there was no evidence of di erence for PHT doses between =/30 mg/d and 730 mg/d (OR 1.93, 95% CI 0.78 to 4.75, P = 0.1554) or TPM doses =/> 25 mg/d to 500 mg/d (OR 1.67, 95% CI 0.69 to 4.04, P = 0.2524) or OXC doses between =/> 75 to 4500 mg/d (OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.31, P = 0.7358). The EURAP 2018 collaboration also compared higher doses of LTG (> 325 mg/d) and found a comparable level of risk to higher doses of CBZ (> 700 mg/d, OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.05, P = 0.0766), to LEV doses between =/> 250-4000 mg/d (OR 1.51, 95% CI 0.79 to 2.88, P = 0.2077) and to OXC doses between 75-4500 mg/d (OR 1.49, 95% CI 0.70 to 3.17, P = 0.3051).Higher doses of LTG (> 325 mg/ d) were not associated with lower rates of MCM compared to the Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews lowest investigated dose range for VPA (=/< 650 mg/d, OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.09, P = 0.0959) but there was evidence suggesting higher doses of LTG were associated with a lower MCM risk than VPA doses between > 650 to =/< 1450 mg/d (OR 2.81, 95% 1.70 to 4.65, P = 0.0002). In contrast to the data from EURAP, the UK and Ireland Epilepsy and Pregnancy Register (N = 2198) found no evidence of risk with increasing doses of LTG (0 to 200 mg/d vs 200 to 400 mg/d; 0 to 200 mg/d vs > 400 mg/d).The North American Epilepsy and Pregnancy Register (N = 1562), the Australian Epilepsy and Pregnancy Register (N = 406), and the Israeli Teratogen Service (N = 114) studies did not identify dose-related risks associated with LTG.The frequency of MCM was too low in other included studies to allow reliable investigation of dose. The prevalence of major malformations (any type) in cohort studies for children exposed to oxcarbazepine (OXC) (N = 378), based on data from 11 studies, was 2.8% (95% CI 1.1 to 6.6).The prevalence of major malformations in routine health record studies for children exposed to OXC (N = 507), based on data from four studies, was 4.8% (95% CI 0.7 to 31.5). 6.1 All major malformations Pooled results from two studies suggested no evidence of a di erence in risk (RR 2.20, 95% CI 0.67 to 7.27; I 2 = 18%), with children exposed to OXC (N = 184) experiencing comparable rates of major malformations to control children (N = 767) (Analysis 6.1). The RD also suggested no di erence in the level of risk (RD 0.01, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.04; I 2 = 0%). Pooled results from six studies suggested no evidence of a di erence in risk (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.68 to 2.91; I 2 = 23%), with children exposed to OXC (N = 134) experiencing comparable rates of major malformations to control children (N = 788) (Analysis 6.1). The RD also suggested no di erence in the level of risk (RD 0.02, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.07; I 2 = 0%). Results from one study found no evidence of a di erence in risk (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.10 to 4.86; I 2 = N/A), with children exposed to OXC (N = 57) experiencing comparable rates of major malformations to control children (N = 369,267) (Analysis 6.1).The RD also suggested no di erence in the level of risk (RD -0.01, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.03; I 2 = N/A). Pooled results from three studies suggested an increased risk with OXC (RR 1.75, 95% CI 1.22 to 2.52; I 2 = 94%), with children exposed to OXC (N = 503) experiencing higher rates of major malformations than control children (N = 11,316) (Analysis 6.1).Due to high heterogeneity, a random-e ects RR was calculated and found no evidence of a di erence in risk (RR 1.61, 95% CI 0.26 to 9.86; I 2 = 94%).The RD suggested a higher risk for OXC (RD 0.03, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.05; I 2 = 94%); however, a random-e ects RD due to heterogeneity found no di erence in the level of risk (RD 0.04, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.12; I 2 = 94%). No included studies reported data for this outcome. We were unable to estimate a RR from the two included studies due to there being no reported neural tube malformations in children exposed to OXC (N = 102) or control children (N = 361) (Analysis 6.2). No included studies reported data on this outcome. The limited published experience of OXC in pregnancy limits dose comparisons, even in the EURAP 2018 study for di erent doses of OXC (N = 333).In EURAP 2018, there was no evidence that doses of OXC between =/> 75 to 4500 mg/d were di erent from those for lower dose LTG (=/< 325 mg/d) (OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.31, P = 0.7282) or dose of LTG > 325 mg/d (OR 1.49, 95% CI 0.70 to 3.17, P = 0.3051).Similarly, a lack of di erence was also found in comparison to any dose of LEV exposure (OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.45 to 2.30, P = 0.9644).A lower prevalence of MCM was found for any dose of OXC (3.0%, 95% CI 1.4 to 5.4) in comparison to low dose VPA (=/< 650 mg/ d, 6.3%, 95% CI 4.5 to 8.6) (OR 2.39, 95% CI 1.13 to 5.08, P = 0.0235), but was not reported for any higher-dose VPA. Other studies were limited to the number of OXC-exposed pregnancies or had not published dose data. The prevalence of major malformations (any type) in cohort studies for children exposed to phenobarbital (PB) (N = 840), based on data from 26 studies, was 6.3% (95% CI 4.8 to 8.3).The prevalence of major malformations in routine health record studies for children exposed to PB (N = 34), based on data from two studies, was 8.8% (95% CI 0.0 to 9722.4). 7.1 All major malformations Pooled results from eight studies suggested an increased risk with PB (RR 3.22, 95% CI 1.84 to 5.65; I 2 = 0%), with children exposed to PB (N = 353) experiencing more major malformations than control children (N = 2042) (Analysis 7.1).The RD also suggested a higher risk for PB (RD 0.04, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.07; I 2 = 0%). Samren 1997 reported five cases of major malformation out of 48 exposed infants (10%).Numbers were more limited in the comparison to control children (as not all centres in the study included control children), with just one malformation case out of six PB-exposed children; analysis suggested no evidence of a di erence between the groups (RR 2.4, 95% CI 0.3 to 23.0). Pooled results from 13 studies suggested no evidence of a di erence in risk (RR 1.64, 95% CI 0.94 to 2.83; I 2 = 0%), with no di erence in the number of major malformations in children exposed to PB (N = 438) and control children (N = 999) (Analysis 7.1). The RD also suggested no di erence in the level of risk (RD 0.02, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.06; I 2 = 0%). The results from one study suggested no evidence of a di erence in risk (RR 2.94, 95% CI 0.77 to 11.15;I 2 = NA), with children exposed to PB (N = 27) experiencing comparable rates of major malformations to control children (N = 369,267) (Analysis 7.1).The RD also suggested no di erence in the level of risk (RD 0.05, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.15; I 2 = NA). The results from one study suggested no evidence of a di erence in risk (RR 2.87, 95% CI 0.74 to 11.21;I 2 = NA), with children exposed to PB (N = 27) experiencing comparable rates of major malformations to control children (N = 1900) (Analysis 7.1).The RD also suggested no di erence in the level of risk (RD 0.05, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.15; I 2 = NA). We were unable to estimate a RR from two studies due to there being no neural tube malformations in children exposed to PB (N = 7) or control children (N = 244) (Analysis 7.2). Pooled results from three studies suggested no evidence of a di erence in risk (RR 3.85, 95% CI 0.47 to 31.26,I 2 = 0%), with no di erence in the number of neural tube malformations in children exposed to PB (N = 146) and control children (N = 512) (Analysis 7.2). The RD also suggested no di erence in the level of risk (RD 0.01, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.03; I 2 = 0%). Pooled results from two studies suggested no evidence of a di erence in risk (RR 7.80, 95% CI 0.36 to 168.52,I 2 = NA) with no di erence in the number of skeletal/limb malformations in children exposed to PB (N = 7) in comparison to control children (N=244).(Analysis 7.5).The RD also suggested no di erence in the level of risk (RD -0.00, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.26; I 2 = NA). Pooled results from three studies suggested no evidence of a di erence in risk (RR 3.01, 95% CI 0.56 to 16.07;I 2 = 0%), with no di erence in the number of skeletal/limb malformations in children exposed to PB (N = 146) and control children (N = 512) (Analysis 7.5). The RD also suggested no di erence in the level of risk (RD 0.01, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.03; I 2 = 0%). No included studies reported data on this outcome. No included studies reported data on this outcome. Despite data being reported in 26 studies, most studies did not investigate dose or report the results of analyses of PB dose with regard to MCM risk or were too limited in terms of the number of included pregnancies.EURAP 2018 included 294 PB monotherapy-exposed cases which is the largest cohort.They found that increasing PB dose was associated with an increasing prevalence of MCM risk.Doses =/< 80 mg/d had a prevalence of 2.7% (95% CI 0.3 to 9.5), doses > 80 to =/< 130 mg/d had a prevalence of 6.2% (95%CI 3.0 to 11. Kaneko 1999 did find an association between PB exposure (N = 79) and increased malformation rate.Other studies were too small or did not investigate an association between PB dose and MCM risk. The prevalence of major malformations (any type) in cohort studies for children exposed to phenytoin (PHT) (N = 1327), based on data Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from 26 studies, was 5.4% (95% CI 3.6 to 8.1).The prevalence of major malformations in routine health record studies for children exposed to PHT (N = 103), based on data from one study, was 6.8% (95% CI 0.1 to 91.3).Samren 1997 reported nine cases of major malformation in 141 (6%) PHT-exposed children.Outcomes at centres with a control group in this study were limited to five cases from 33 exposed children, which gave a non-significant di erence (RR 2.2, 95% CI 0.7 to 6.7). Pooled results from 15 studies suggested an increased risk with PHT (RR 2.01, 95% CI 1.29 to 3.12; I 2 = 0%), with children exposed to PHT (N = 750) experiencing more major malformations than control children (N = 1588) (Analysis 8.1).The RD also suggested a higher risk for PHT (RD 0.03, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.05; I 2 = 0%). No included studies reported data on this outcome. No included studies reported data on this outcome. Pooled results from four studies suggested no evidence of a di erence in risk (RR 13.17, 95% CI 0.58 to 299.00,I 2 = NA) with no di erence in the number of neural tube malformations in children exposed to PHT (N = 48) and control children (N = 590) (Analysis 8.2). The RD also suggested no di erence in the level of risk (RD -0.00, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.06; I 2 = 0%). Pooled results from six studies suggested no evidence of a di erence in risk (RR 2.56, 95% CI 0.64 to 10.17; I 2 = 28%), with no di erence in the number of neural tube malformations in children exposed to PHT (N = 252) and control children (N = 595) (Analysis 8.2).The RD also suggested no di erence in the level of risk (RD 0.01, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.03; I 2 = 0%). Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Pooled results from four studies suggested no evidence of a di erence in risk (RR 1.56, 95% CI 0.07 to 37.19, I 2 = NA), with no di erence in the number of skeletal/limb malformations in children exposed to PHT (N = 48) and control children (N = 590) (Analysis 8.5). The RD also suggested no di erence in the level of risk (RD -0.00, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.06; I 2 = 0%). Pooled results from six studies suggested no evidence of a di erence in risk (RR 1.57, 95% CI 0.31 to 7.95; I 2 = 0%), with no di erence in the number of skeletal/limb malformations in children exposed to PHT (N = 252) and control children (N = 595) (Analysis 8.5).The RD also suggested no di erence in the level of risk (RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.02; I 2 = 0%). No included studies reported data on this outcome. No included studies reported data on this outcome. The majority of included studies did not investigate or formally report on the relationship between the dose of PHT and malformation outcome, with many being limited by included numbers of PHT-exposed pregnancies. The prevalence of major malformations (any type) in cohort studies for children exposed to primidone (PRM) (N = 112), based on data from seven studies, was 7.9% (95% CI 2.6 to 21.5).The prevalence of major malformations in routine health record studies for children exposed to PRM (N = 3), was based on data from one study and therefore was not calculated. The results from one study (Koch 1992) suggested no evidence of a di erence in risk (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.03 to 8.43, I 2 = NA) (Analysis 9.1) with no di erence in the number of major malformations in children exposed to PRM (N = 21) and control children (N = 116).The RD also suggested no di erence in the level of risk (RD -0.04, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.03; I 2 = NA). Samren 1997 reported four cases of major malformations out of 43 PRM-exposed children (9%).When limited to centres with control children, there were three cases out of 39 exposed children, which suggested no evidence of di erence from control children (RR 1.0, 95% CI 0.3 to 3.8). Pooled results from six studies suggested an increased risk with PRM (RR 3.61, 95% CI 1.41 to 9.23; I 2 = 8%), with children exposed to PRM (N = 108) experiencing more major malformations than control children (N = 573) (Analysis 9.1).The RD also suggested a higher risk for PRM (RD 0.07, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.14; I 2 = 11%). No included studies reported data on this outcome. No included studies reported data on this outcome.Specific malformation types were not reviewed due to no reported data on these outcomes. No included studies investigated the dose of PRM and malformation risk. The prevalence of major malformations (any type) in cohort studies for children exposed to topiramate (TPM) (N = 510), based on data from eight studies, was 3.9% (95% CI 2.3 to 6.5).The prevalence of major malformations in routine health record studies for children exposed to TPM (N = 49), based on data from two studies, was 4.1% (95% CI 0.0 to 27,060).Pooled data from three studies suggested an increased risk with TPM (RR 4.07, 95% CI 1.64 to 10.14; I 2 = 0%), with children exposed to TPM (N = 367) experiencing more major malformations than control children (N = 825) (Analysis 10.1).The RD also suggested a higher risk for TPM (RD 0.03, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.06; I 2 = 0). Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. There was just one case of MCM in 41 monotherapy cases described by the Israeli Teratogen Service, giving a prevalence of 4.9%, which suggested no di erence in risk to control children (3.4%, P value not reported). Pooled results from five studies suggested no evidence of a di erence in risk (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.57 to 3.27; I 2 = 0%), with no di erence in the number of major malformations in children exposed to TPM (N = 139) and control children (N = 1080) (Analysis 10.1).The RD also suggested no di erence in the level of risk (RD 0.01, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.04; I 2 = 0%). The results from one study suggested no evidence of a di erence in risk (RR 1.65, 95% CI 0.43 to 6.42; I 2 = NA), with children exposed to TPM (N = 48) experiencing comparable rates of major malformations to control children (N = 369,267) (Analysis 10.1).The RD also suggested no di erence in the level of risk (RD 0.02, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.07; I 2 = NA). The results from one study suggested no evidence of a di erence in risk (RR 1.62, 95% CI 0.40 to 6.45; I 2 = NA), with children exposed to TPM (N = 48) experiencing comparable rates of major malformations to control children (N = 1900) (Analysis 10.1).The RD also suggested no di erence in the level of risk (RD 0.02, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.07; I 2 = NA). We were unable to estimate a RR from two studies due to there being no reported neural tube malformations in children exposed to TPM (N = 8) or control children (N = 383) (Analysis 10.2). Pooled data from two included studies suggested evidence of a di erence in risk (RR 20.71, 95% CI 2.64 to 162.72,I 2 = 0%), with children exposed to TPM (N = 8) experiencing more cardiac malformations than control children (N = 383) (Analysis 10.3). However, the RD suggested no di erence in the level of risk (RD 0.12, 95% CI -0.16 to 0.39; I 2 = 0%). Pooled data from four included studies suggested no evidence of a di erence in risk (RR 2.48, 95% CI 0.49 to 12.49; I 2 = NA), with no di erence in the number of cardiac malformations in children exposed to TPM (N = 60) and control children (N = 510) (Analysis 10.3).The RD also suggested no di erence in the level of risk (RD 0.01, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.06; I 2 = 0%). No included studies reported data on this outcome. No included studies reported data on this outcome.We were unable to estimate a RR from two studies due to there being no reported oro-facial cle / craniofacial malformations in children exposed to TPM (N = 8) or control children (N = 383) (Analysis 10.4). Pooled data from three included studies suggested no evidence of a di erence in risk (RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.09 to 24.92;I 2 = NA), with no di erence in the number of oro-facial cle /craniofacial malformations in children exposed to TPM (N = 51) and control children (N = 170) (Analysis 10.4).The RD also suggested no di erence in the level of risk (RD -0.00, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.04; I 2 = 0%). No included studies reported data on this outcome to be included in the meta-analysis.However, the study by Hernandez-Diaz and colleagues using US Medicaid Registers could not be included in the meta-analysis due to a lack of reporting of specific numbers of oral cle s.In comparison to children born to women without epilepsy (N = 1,322,955), the children exposed to TPM (N = 2425) had higher rates of oral cle s of 4.1 per 1000 live births (RR 3.63, 95% CI 1.95 to 6.76). No included studies reported data on this outcome.We were unable to estimate a RR from two studies due to there being no reported skeletal/limb malformations in children exposed to TPM (N = 8) or control children (N = 383) (Analysis 10.5). Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Pooled data from three included studies suggested no evidence of a di erence in risk (RR 2.06, 95% CI 0.24 to 17.42; I 2 = 0%), with no di erence in the number of skeletal/limb malformations in children exposed to TPM (N = 59) and control children (N = 502) (Analysis 10.5).The RD also suggested no di erence in the level of risk (RD -0.01, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.04; I 2 = 0%). No included studies reported data on this outcome. No included studies reported data on this outcome. The largest included cohort of TPM-exposed pregnancies came from the study by Hernandez-Diaz using data from the US Medicaid Registers (N = 2425).This register reported the risk of oral cle s for doses ≤ 100 mg/d as 2.4 per 1000 live births, and for doses > 100 mg/d, as 7.3 per 1000 live births.The adjusted values of corresponding adjusted RRs for daily doses ≤ 100 and > 100 mg were 1.64 (95% CI 0.53 to 5.07) and 5.16 (95% CI 1.94 to 13.73) for lower and higher doses, respectively.The data were too limited to provide dose investigations specifically for women with epilepsy, but they did report that higher doses tended to be used for women requiring TPM for the treatment of epilepsy. North American Epilepsy and Pregnancy Register found no evidence of a di erence in the median dose between TPM-exposed children (N = 359) who had MCM versus those who did not (P value not reported).The Australian Epilepsy and Pregnancy Register (N = 53), did not find a dose association for monotherapy TPM but did see an increase in risk with polytherapy (prevalence not given). The UK and Ireland Epilepsy and Pregnancy Register cohort (N = 70) also failed to find an association between the dose of TPM and the risk of overall MCM.However, caution is required due to smaller numbers from the Epilepsy and Pregnancy Register cohorts currently for monotherapy TPM exposure in pregnancy. The prevalence of major malformations (any type) in cohort studies for children exposed to valproate (VPA) (N = 3018), based on data from 31 studies, was 9.8% (95% CI 8.1 to 11.9).The prevalence of major malformations in routine health record studies for children exposed to VPA (N = 1364), based on data from six studies, was 9.7% (95% CI 7.1 to 13.4). Pooled results from eight studies suggested an increased risk with VPA (RR 5.64, 95% CI 1.37 to 23.24;I 2 = 0%), with a higher number of neural tube malformations in children exposed to VPA (N = 814) than in control children (N = 664) (Analysis 11.2).The RD also suggested a higher risk for VPA (RD 0.02, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.03; I 2 = 6%). Pooled results from 10 studies suggested an increased risk with VPA (RR 2.71, 95% CI 1.42 to 5.17; I 2 = 0%), with a higher number of cardiac malformations in children exposed to VPA (N = 821) than in control children (N = 676) (Analysis 11.3).The RD also suggested a higher risk for VPA (RD 0.03, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.05; I 2 = 0%).

Pooled results from four studies suggested no evidence of a di erence in risk (RR 2.76, 95% CI 0.31 to 24.78;I 2 = NA), with no di erence in the number of oro-facial cle /craniofacial malformations in children exposed to VPA (N = 104) and control children (N = 836) (Analysis 11.4).The RD also suggested no di erence in the level of risk (RD 0.01, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.04; I 2 = 0%). Pooled results from eight studies suggested an increased risk with VPA (RR 4.44, 95% CI 1.14 to 17.27; I 2 = 2%), with more children exposed to VPA (N = 474) experiencing oro-facial cle /craniofacial malformations than control children (N = 332) (Analysis 11.4).The RD also suggested a higher risk for VPA (RD 0.02, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.05; I 2 = 0%).

Pooled results from eight studies suggested no evidence of a di erence in risk (RR 2.38, 95% CI 0.93 to 6.12; I 2 = 0%), with no di erence in the number of skeletal/limb malformations in children exposed to VPA (N = 814) and control children (N = 664) (Analysis 11.5).The RD also suggested no di erence in the level of risk (RD 0.01, 95% CI -0.00 to 0.03; I 2 = 0%). No included studies reported data on this outcome. No included studies reported data on this outcome. In contrast to the results on dosage for the other AEDs, for VPA there appears to be a consistently documented and clear association between increased dose and the risk for MCM in VPA-exposed children.EURAP 2018 reported evidence that suggested a doserelated MCM risk for VPA exposure.In 1381 exposed pregnancies, the MCM risk ranged from 6.3% (95% CI 4.5 to 8.6%) for doses =/< 650 mg/d, to 11.3% for doses > 650 mg/d to =/< 1450 mg/day and, most concerning, 25 The prevalence of major malformations (any type) in cohort studies for children exposed to zonisamide (ZNS) (N = 130), based on data from four studies, was 2.7% (95% CI 0.1 to 47.3).There were no children exposed to ZNS in routine health record studies, therefore, the prevalence of major malformations rated could not be calculated. 12.1.All major malformations Pooled data from two studies suggested no evidence of a di erence in risk (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.21 to 6.11; I 2 = 36%), with no di erence in the number of major malformations in children exposed to ZNS (N = 103) and control children (N = 548) (Analysis 12.1).The RD also suggested no di erence in the level of risk (RD -0.00, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.02; I 2 = 39%). Pooled data from two studies suggested an increased risk with ZNS (RR 3.20, 95% CI 1.09 to 9.43; I 2 = 0%), with a higher number of major malformations in children exposed to ZNS (N = 39) than in control children (N = 556) (Analysis 12.1).However, the RD suggested no di erence in the level of risk (RD 0.07, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.18; I 2 = 0%).

The publications of EURAP 2018; Samren 1997 required narrative reporting due to their overlap with other research initiatives.Israeli Teratogen Service showed variability in its reporting and, therefore, required narrative reporting for certain outcomes.Further, studies using US Medicaid Registers also required narrative review due to the format of reporting of the monotherapy TPM and GBP pregnancies in women with epilepsy. We reported results from three study types, meta-analysis of data from cohort studies, data from EURAP 2018 and others, and meta-analysis of data from epidemiological health record studies. Each study design has its inherent methodological strengths and weaknesses.We undertook a stratified approach to evidence synthesis to ensure a sensitive approach to combining data and to allow for the development of evidence groupings; this will allow for replication of findings across di erent study types and will also allow for increased confidence in the evidence . The meta-analyses included 17,964 ASM-exposed pregnancies from cohort studies and 7913 from routine health record studies; additional exposed pregnancies from the EURAP collaboration and other studies were reviewed narratively.Individual ASM prevalence of major malformation ranged from 2.0% to 9.8% for cohort study data and 3.6% to 9.7% for studies utilising routine health record data (Table 1 , Figure 3 ).Summary of findings 1 and Summary of findings 2 along with Table 1 , Table 2 , Table 3 , Table 4 , Table 5 , Table 6 and Table 7 provide a summary of the meta-analysis results for all comparisons for risk of major malformation.This update has included the most recent study data, which strengthens the previously identified risk associations for older ASMs such as CBZ, PB and VPA, where the comparisons include large numbers of exposed pregnancies.For other ASMs, there are some di erences in the results across the comparisons, but the better powered comparisons demonstrate an increased risk for PHT and for an overall major malformation risk with CBZ and for TPM. Whilst CBZ, PB, PHT, TPM and VPA are associated with an increase in the risk of major malformation, the level of risk varies between the four ASMs.For example, CBZ showed a lower overall major malformation risk rate than PB and VPA, and a lower risk for specific major malformation types compared to some ASMs (e.g.PB or TPM).All ASMs, regardless of their own association with an increased risk, carried a lower risk than VPA-exposure which had the highest prevalence from both cohort (9.8%) and routine health record data (9.7%).LTG remains the lowest risk ASM with adequate cohort size (N => 4700 pregnancies from cohort studies and N = 2502 from routine health record studies).LTG does appear to have a dose e ect, as do CBZ, PB and VPA.The number of LEVexposed pregnancies remains more limited than LTG but, in direct comparison, there is currently no significant di erence between these two ASMs, and LEV-exposed children have a lower overall Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews major malformation risk than CBZ, VPA and PHT.TPM exposure was associated with a higher overall major malformation risk in comparison to LTG, but not other ASMs; this finding may be due to relatively small numbers of participants in the TPM studies and only a few malformation events.TPM exposure, however, was associated with higher specific risks of oro-facial, craniofacial, skeletal and limb malformations in comparison to LTG, LEV, CBZ, but not in comparison to the two control groups; but specific major malformation data were limited for the control cohorts. There remains limited information for GBP, OXC, TPM and ZNS and other \\'newer\\' medications.The evidence for each ASM monotherapy is summarised below. CBZ was the most frequently investigated ASM both in terms of the number of publications and the number of included pregnancies (over 8220).The pooled major malformation prevalence for CBZ was 4.7% (95% CI, 3.7 to 5.9) from cohort studies, 4.0% (95% CI 3.0 to 5.4) for routine health record studies and 2.9% (95% CI 2.9 to 5.4); these were relatively consistent with the 5.5% (95% CI 4.5 to 6.6) prevalence from EURAP 2018 (Figure 3 ). In comparison to both children born to women without epilepsy and children born to women with untreated epilepsy, pooled data from the cohort studies found that children exposed to CBZ in utero had an increased risk of having a major malformation, with the di erence in risk ranging from 1% to 2%, respectively.The findings from routine health record studies are more mixed.In the larger of the two comparisons, CBZ was significantly associated with a higher risk of a major malformation, which was consistent with the cohort study data. In comparison to unexposed control children (both groups), there was no specific malformation which was increased above the background rate provided by the control children.Data were limited in terms of the specific malformation risk, mainly due to the absence of control data from some large pregnancy and epilepsy registry studies (e.g.North American Epilepsy and Pregnancy Register; UK and Ireland Epilepsy and Pregnancy Register) and reporting of this level of detail from the population datasets (e.g.Denmark Health Record Registers; UK Clinical Research Practice Database; UK Health Record THIN Register).This likely contributed to the non-significant outcomes found for neural tube malformations, which has been an association found by others using di erent methodologies (Jentink 2010b ). Data from the cohort studies were more numerous for CBZ-exposed pregnancies compared to other monotherapy ASMs.There was a higher risk of major malformation in comparison to children exposed to LEV or LTG in comparisons which included over 500 pregnancies in each arm, with the risk being 1% higher.However, comparisons at the specific malformation level were not significant; this was likely due to fewer data being available at this level of investigation.The increased risk observed in data from cohort studies was not replicated in studies using databases containing routine health records, however, patient/ event numbers in the databases were smaller than the pooled experience from cohort studies. Despite its associated higher risk, CBZ exposure was associated with a lower level of risk than VPA exposure, with a 5% di erence in overall major malformation risk and a lower risk across neural tube, cardiac, oro-facial and skeletal/limb malformations.Further, while CBZ is comparable to the increased risk from PB, PHT or TPM in data from cohort studies for overall major malformation, the specific malformation risk varied.The association of CBZ exposure with cardiac malformations was lower in comparison to PB or to PHT exposure and lower for skeletal/limb or oro-facial/craniofacial malformation risk when compared to TPM exposure. There was no significant increase in risk in comparison to OXC, GBP, PRM or CZP exposure from both cohort and health record studies, but data were more limited for these comparator ASMs currently and caution is required. Dose is a key feature of teratogenic malformation risk (Brent 2004 ).Data from EURAP 2018 is the most reliable to investigate dose associations due to its large number of CBZ-exposed pregnancies and its low risk of bias on the domain of outcome measurement.It demonstrates a dose-related risk for CBZ with doses over 700 mg/d carrying a higher risk, although even their lower dose group had a high level of risk in comparison to children exposed to LTG (EURAP 2018). Data relating to the use of monotherapy clonazepam during pregnancy and child major malformation risk is substantially limited with fewer than 150 pregnancies reported across both cohort and routine health record studies.The generated prevalence reported here was 2.1% (95% CI 0.2 to 17.3%) to 2.5% (95% CI 0.0 to 131.8) but the confidence intervals were very wide, due to the limited data.When compared to other ASMs, however, a lower risk was identified in comparison to VPA exposure, with a risk di erence of 9%.Due to the current limited data available, no firm conclusion can be made currently whether CZP is associated with an increased risk in comparison to control children. Experience with GBP exposure in pregnancy was also limited. Outcomes from only 210 reported pregnancies could be included in our meta-analysis.The pooled prevalence of major malformation was 2.0% (95% CI 0.1 to 32.2) from cohort studies, with too few data being available from studies using routine health records to provide a pooled prevalence rate.We found no di erence between the children exposed to GBP compared with either type of control group, but caution is warranted due to limited numbers.Data which could not be included in meta-analysis, from the US Medicaid Registers, found that children exposed to GBP (N = 347) for the indication of maternal epilepsy were not at a greater risk of major malformation, which matched the wider finding from 3745 GBP-exposed pregnancies (any indication).Whilst this study may o er reassurance, caution is required as the indications were not predominantly epilepsy and, therefore, there may be di erences in typically prescribed doses; replication of this finding is also required in another adequately powered cohort. We found no di erence in overall major malformation rate or in the specific malformations investigated for the children exposed to GBP compared to CBZ, LTG, LEV, OXC, PHT, PB, TPM and ZNS, but there was a very limited number of GBP-exposed children. In comparison to the children exposed to VPA, children exposed Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews to GBP in utero had a significantly lower risk (8%) of having a malformation than children exposed to VPA, but data were too limited to investigate specific malformation di erences. Data for GBP dose and malformation rate were limited from cohort studies but data from the US Medicaid Registers failed to find an association between higher doses of GBP and a higher risk of malformation.However, the vast majority of women taking GBP were doing so for conditions other than epilepsy and, therefore, caution is warranted. The use of LTG has increased over the last decade in women of childbearing age (Ackers 2009; Man 2012; Wen 2015).The pooled prevalence of major malformation for LTG was 2.7% (95% CI 1.9 to 3.8%) from cohort studies, 3.5% (95% CI 2.5 to 4.9) from routine health record studies, and 2.9% (95% CI 2.3 to 3.7) from the EURAP 2018 collaboration.Most of the evidence indicated no di erence in the overall major malformation rate between the children exposed to LTG and either type of control group.However, in comparison to children born to women without epilepsy, there was a significant di erence from the pooled cohort data, with the risk being increased by 1% for the children exposed to LTG.Whilst levels of heterogeneity were not increased overall, one study had a much higher rate of malformation in the LTG group.Further, a larger LTG-exposed group was available for comparison to the women with epilepsy who were not treated, which showed the LTG major malformation risk was not significantly di erent from the control children for overall malformation rate or for the specific malformation types investigated; this was consistent with the non-significant finding from the routine health record studies in comparison to both control groups.Further, no increase in specific malformation types were identified, and data from the US Medicaid Registers failed to find an association with oral cle malformations in over 2000 LTG-exposed children in comparison to control children who were not exposed to ASMs. In comparison to LEV, which has also seen a significant increase in use in women of childbearing age in a lot of countries (Meador 2009; Wen 2015), there were no significant di erences for LTG in either the overall major malformation rate or the specific malformation types investigated.Children exposed to LTG also did not di er either in terms of overall major malformation rate or in terms of specific malformations compared with children exposed to OXC, CZP, GBP and ZNS; however, data were limited for all of these comparisons due to small numbers of OXC, CZP, GBP and ZNSexposed pregnancies. The children exposed to LTG were at a significantly lower risk of overall major malformation compared with children exposed to CBZ, PB, PHT and TPM exposures (see results for specific risk levels) in cohort study data.Routine health record studies did not replicate this, however, were limited in terms of numbers of included LTG-exposed pregnancies in comparison to PB, PHT and TPM and, therefore, were perceived as less reliable.Analyses of cohort study data showed that, at the specific malformation level, children exposed to LTG were at a lower risk of cardiac malformations in comparison to PB and PHT exposures and fewer skeletal malformations than children exposed to TPM and PHT.This latter finding was also observed in the large cohort from the US Medicaid Registers.Finally, children exposed to LTG had a threefold lower risk of overall major malformation when compared to the children exposed to VPA, with a risk di erence showing that the significant reduction in risk was 6% for children exposed to LTG.Neural tube, cardiac, oro-facial cle , craniofacial, skeletal and limb malformations were all significantly lower for the LTG-exposed children. The large, well-designed EURAP 2018 study has demonstrated a dose relationship between LTG treatment and major malformation risk, with exposures to LTG ≤ 325 mg/d associated with the lowest malformation prevalence.Other studies did not find a dose relationship, however, the EURAP 2018 collaboration is by far the largest and most standardised in their assessment of the malformation, comprising of participants from 42 countries (N = 2514).Therefore, higher doses of LTG may be associated with higher levels of risk and this should be considered when prescribing doses over 325 mg/d.It is possible that this dose association may account, at least in part, for the variation seen in the outcome in one of the control comparisons. The frequency of data and the number of included pregnancies exposed to LEV were more limited than for CBZ, LTG or VPA.There were 1242 LEV-exposed pregnancies included from cohort data across all comparisons and just 248 from studies employing routine health record data currently.This delay is likely due in part to the time it takes for adequate numbers of women taking newer ASMs to accumulate, however, it undermines counselling for a now commonly established medication (Meador 2009; Wen 2015). The pooled prevalence for major malformation occurrences following LEV-exposure was 2.6% (95% CI 1.6 to 4.4) for cohort study data, 2.8% (95% CI 0.0 to 321.9) for routine health record study data (which had large confidence intervals) and 2.8% (95% CI 1.7 to 4.5) from EURAP 2018.There was no significant di erence between the children exposed to LEV and control children in the meta-analysis for overall major malformation rate; these comparisons also both contained > 1000 pregnancies in each arm.Data pertaining to specific malformation types in comparison to control children were limited, however, and it is not possible to draw conclusions until more data are available. In comparison to other ASM treatments, children exposed to LEV were not significantly di erent from children exposed to LTG in terms of overall major malformation prevalence or the specific malformation types investigated.In addition, we found no significant di erence between children exposed to LEV compared with those exposed to GBP, OXC, CZP, TPM ZNS or PRM, although data within these comparisons were somewhat limited.Children exposed to LEV had a lower overall MCM rate than the children exposed to CBZ, PB and PHT exposures, but there was no di erence in terms of the specific malformation types investigated.While the overall major malformation risk was not significantly di erent for the children exposed to LEV versus those exposed to TPM, the children exposed to LEV were at lower risk of having an orofacial/craniofacial, skeletal or limb malformation in comparison to the TPM-exposed children.Additionally, children exposed to LEV had a lower specific risk of developing a cardiac malformation in comparison to PB-exposed children.Finally, the children exposed to LEV had a 7 to 8% lower risk of overall malformations compared with the children exposed to VPA, with a lower risk identified for all investigated specific types of malformations for the children exposed to LEV.Caution is required, therefore, regarding the malformation risk with above average doses of LEV, until more data are available. Data for pregnancy outcomes following exposure to OXC were limited to just under 400 pregnancies in cohort studies and 507 pregnancies from routine health record studies.The prevalence of major malformation was 2.8% (95% CI 1.1 to 6.6) versus 4.8% (95% CI 0.7 to 31.5) with routine health record studies containing more OXC-exposed pregnancies across comparisons.The prevalence reported from EURAP 2018 for 333 OXC monotherapy-exposed pregnancies was 3.0% (95% CI 1.4 to 5.4). In comparison to control children, the pooled routine health record study data found no elevated risk for OXC exposure in comparison to controls; these results were similar in the cohort study data. Given the numbers of included OXC-exposed pregnancies across both study types, further research is required for conclusions to be drawn in regard to OXC exposure and major malformation outcome.While limited comparisons to other ASMs could be made, where evidence was available, there was no significant di erence between the overall major malformation rate or the specific malformations investigated compared with children exposed to CBZ, CZP, LEV, LTG, GBP, PHT, PB, TPM, PRM and ZNS.Children exposed to OXC were at a significantly lower risk of having an major malformation of any type compared with children exposed to VPA, with the risk di erence being 4 to 6% depending on the study type.There were very limited data pertaining to specific malformation types, and caution is required. Only EURAP 2018 reported dose and malformation rates for OXCexposed pregnancies.Whilst they did not compare lower versus higher OXC dose, they did report that certain dose levels of OXC were comparable to lower-dose LTG.More studies of OXC-exposed pregnancies are required, however, before it is determined whether a higher level of OXC dose carries a higher malformation risk. Despite years of use, data from prospective studies investigating PB as monotherapy were surprisingly limited, with only 840 monotherapy-exposed pregnancies across the di erent comparisons and study types.The data pooled from included studies generated a major malformation prevalence of 6.3% (95% CI 4.8 to 8.3) from cohort studies and 8.8% (95% CI 0.0 to 9722.4) from routine health record studies; the latter was limited in cohort size and the prevalence should be interpreted with caution.There was a prevalence of 6.5% (95% CI 4.2 to 9.9) from EURAP 2018. The results regarding PB-exposure in comparison to control children demonstrated variable results.We found a significantly increased risk of overall major malformation compared with children born to women without epilepsy, with a risk di erence of 4%.However, we found no significant di erence compared with children born to women without epilepsy.However, both comparisons included under 500 PB-exposed pregnancies, which may account for the unstable pattern of the findings.Routine health record data studies included too few PB-exposed pregnancies at this time to provide reliable estimates.Data pertaining to specific malformations were extremely limited or missing and likely contributed to the non-significant di erences found for PB in comparison to the control children.This is certainly the case for cardiac malformations, where rates of cardiac malformations are increased in comparison to numerous other ASMs exposures. In comparison to other ASMs, children exposed to PB were not at a significantly increased rate of overall major malformation compared with children exposed to CBZ, CZP, GBP, PHT, OXC, TPM, PRM, LEV and ZNS exposures; but the comparison to CBZ exposure was the only one where the PB-exposed group had over 500 pregnancies.PB exposure was significantly associated with an increased risk of oro-facial cle s and craniofacial malformations when compared to LEV or LTG exposures.Children exposed to PB had a higher overall major malformation than the children exposed to LTG, but a lower risk compared with the children exposed to VPA, with the risk being 4% lower.Therefore, despite both PB and VPA being associated with an increased risk of being born with an major malformation, the risk associated with VPA is significantly higher, including for cardiac malformations. The majority of studies did not investigate or report on a potential relationship between dose of PB and major malformation risk, due to limited included pregnancies.A dose-mediated risk was also apparent for cardiac malformations, with the prevalence increasing from 1% to 8% for doses < 150 mg/d and those ≥ 150 mg/d, respectively (EURAP 2018).Samren 1997 also found a dose e ect for PB.Given the size of the EURAP 2018 cohort and their standardised approach to reviewing, it is concluded that there is likely a strong dose relationship for PB. The pooled prevalence of major malformation in the PHT-exposed children was 5.4% (95% CI 3.6 to 8.1%) for cohort studies, 6.8% (95% CI 0.1 to 701.2%) for routine health record studies and 6.4% (95% CI 2.8 to 12.2%) for EURAP 2018.There were 1327 PHT-exposed pregnancies included in the cohort studies, but just 103 children reported from routine health record studies.The children exposed to PHT were at a significantly increased risk in comparison with both types of control group, with the di erence in risk being 3% in the cohort data.However, we found no association between PHT and specific major malformation types; although data were limited in these comparisons due to the limited control data reported in publications from the epilepsy and pregnancy registers. In comparison to other ASMs, children exposed to PHT were not at an increased risk of overall major malformation compared with children exposed to CZP, CBZ, GBP, OXC, TPM, PRM, PB or ZNS; however, data comparing PHT with the \\'newer\\' ASMs were limited and caution is needed in the interpretation of these nonsignificant findings.In contrast, compared to studies with a greater number of included children, the children exposed to PHT were at an increased risk of overall major malformation compared with children exposed to LTG or LEV, with the risk di erence indicating a 2% increase in major malformation; however, these RDs were not statistically significant.In contrast, the children exposed to PHT were significantly less likely to have a major malformation than the children exposed to VPA, with the di erence in risk being 5% lower.Further, the children exposed to PHT were also at a lower risk Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews than those exposed to VPA for their risk of neural tube, cardiac and skeletal/limb malformations. In terms of specific malformations, children exposed to PHT were less likely than those exposed to PB to have a craniofacial malformation.There was a noted increase in cardiac, skeletal and limb malformations for the PHT-exposed children compared with those exposed to LTG, which was one of the larger comparisons in terms of PHT-exposed pregnancies.Finally, the rates of neural tube, cardiac, skeletal and limb malformations were significantly lower for the children exposed to PHT in comparison to the VPA-exposed children. The majority of studies did not report on whether the risk of being born with a major malformation was associated with dose of PHT; however, those that did investigate such an association did not show a consistent pattern (Kaaja 2003; Kaneko 1999; Motherisk Registry; North American Epilepsy and Pregnancy Register; Samren 1997), therefore, the conclusion around dose e ects is uncertain. This is an old ASM with limited utilisation currently.Evidence pertaining to PRM was extremely limited to 112 pregnancies and caution is warranted when interpreting results.Pooled data from included cohort studies gave a malformation prevalence of 7.9% (95% CI 2.6 to 21.5%).There were just 3 PRM-exposed cases reported in the routine health record studies.The children exposed to PRM were at a higher risk of overall major malformation in comparison to the children born to women with an untreated epilepsy, which contained the larger number of PRM-exposed pregnancies.A comparable major malformation risk was found for PRM in comparison to PHT, PB and VPA exposures, but the data were limited.There was either extremely limited or no data available to compare risks to other monotherapy ASMs. Only one study of 19 PRM cases investigated the dose of PRM and outcome (Kaneko 1999).Therefore, it remains unknown whether there is an association between PRM dose and increased major malformation risk. Experience with TPM was limited to 510 exposed pregnancies in cohort studies (3.9%, 95% CI 2.3 to 6.5%).There were 49 cases from routine health record investigations which met the criteria for being included in the meta-analyses (4.1%, 95% CI 0.0 to 27,060.0);therefore, caution is required when considering our results.The EURAP 2018 collaboration is also limited currently in its experience with TPM exposures with just 152 exposed pregnancies with a major malformation prevalence of 3.9% (95% CI 1.5 to 8.4%). In pooled cohort data, in comparison to children born to women without epilepsy, children exposed to TPM had a higher rate of being born with an major malformation with the risk di erence being 3%.We found no significant di erence compared with the no medication control group, but this comparison had even fewer TPM cases.Pooled data were too limited here to allow for the investigation of specific malformation outcomes in comparison to control children.We found no significant di erence in the rate of major malformation compared with children exposed to CBZ, CZP GBP, PHT, PB, PRM, OXC and ZNS.We found a significant increase in the rate of major malformation for the children exposed to TPM compared with the children exposed to LTG, with skeletal/limb and oro-facial cle /craniofacial being specifically increased. Data from US Medicaid Registers provides the largest dataset regarding oro-facial cle s and reported an association between topiramate and oral cle s from medical reimbursement databases (4.1 per 1000 live births).This is similar to a retrospective study which was not included in this review (Mines 2014), in a casecontrol study (Margulis 2012) , and in a previous meta-analysis (Alsaad 2015) which were beyond the inclusion criteria of this review.This demonstrates the cohort sizes which are required to investigate very specific rare events, such as specific types of major malformation. The overall major malformation risk was comparable to that for LEV or CBZ-exposed children, but the LEV-exposed children were at a lower risk of skeletal and limb malformations, as were the CBZexposed children.The children exposed to TPM had a lower cardiac risk than the children exposed to PB, and they were less likely to have a malformation of any type compared with the children exposed to VPA, with the di erence in risk being 7%. Most studies were too limited to be able to provide reliable investigations into a dose association, however, Hernandez-Diaz, using (US Medicaid Registers) data, found that the adjusted RRs for oro-facial cle s at doses ≤ 100 mg/d and > 100 mg/d were 1.64 (95% CI 0.53 to 5.07) and 5.16 (95% CI 1.94 to 13.73) for lower and higher doses, respectively. In utero exposure to VPA and its possible association with an increased teratological risk has been discussed in the literature since the 1980s, when the first case reports emerged documenting children with a specific constellation of malformations following exposure to VPA (Ardinger 1988 In the meta-analyses reported here a consistent pattern emerged: children exposed to VPA were at an increased risk of both a higher overall major malformation risk and risk of specific malformations including neural tube, cardiac, oro-facial cle , craniofacial, skeletal and limb malformations.The prevalence of major malformation following exposure to VPA in the womb was 9.8% (95% CI 8.1 to 11.9) for cohort studies, with similar rates from routine health record studies (9.7%, 95% CI 7.1 to 13.4) and from EURAP 2018 (10.3, 95% CI 8.8 to 12.0%).Children exposed to VPA were at an increased risk of being born with a major malformation compared with both the children of women without epilepsy and the children of women with untreated epilepsy, with the risk di erence being 7% and 6% compared with the respective control groups.Analysis of the risks associated with VPA treatment at the specific malformation Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews level was limited by a lack of control data; however, children exposed to VPA remained at a significantly increased risk for neural tube, cardiac and skeletal malformations compared with control children. In comparison to other ASMs, in the meta-analyses reported here, children exposed to VPA were at an increased risk of major malformation compared with children exposed to CBZ, CZP, GBP, LEV, LTG, TPM, OXC, PB and PHT, with the ZNS group being nonsignificant but too being small to make a reliable comparison.The increased risk associated with VPA exposure ranged from 4% to 9%, depending on the comparator ASM. At the specific malformation level, children exposed to VPA were at an increased risk of neural tube malformation compared with the children exposed to CBZ, LEV, LTG and PHT.We did not note any increase in the specific malformation type analyses compared to children exposed to GBP, OXC, PB or TPM, but this is most likely due to limited data.However, we found an increased rate of cardiac malformation compared to CBZ, LEV, LTG, TPM, PHT and an equal cardiac risk in comparison to the increased risk for PBexposed children.Oro-facial cle and craniofacial malformations were also significantly more common in the children exposed to VPA compared with children exposed to CBZ, LEV and LTG.There was no di erence in the rate of oro-facial cle or craniofacial malformations compared with TPM, PB or PHT, but these are found to carry their own risks of this malformation type (US Medicaid Registers).Finally, skeletal or limb malformations in children exposed to VPA compared with children exposed to CBZ, LEV, LTG or PHT were significantly higher.All specific malformation comparisons that the data compared with CZP, GBP, ZNS and OXC were too limited for conclusions to be made. When weighing up the risks and benefits of VPA treatment, the e ects of VPA on other developmental outcomes including the developing brain should also be considered when considering the level of risk posed by VPA.VPA exposure is now also recognised as a neurobehavioural teratogen, with implications for the future cognitive functioning of the exposed child (Bromley 2014) , and an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autistic spectrum disorders (Christensen 2013)  Either no, or very limited numbers, of pregnancies were found for other ASMs from the searches such as ethosuximide, sulthiame, perampanel, lacosamide or vigabatrin. E orts were made to ensure that the evidence presented here was as complete as possible by including the two dominant research study designs for this area of research; cohort study designs and datasets which contain routinely collected health records.However, we did not include case-control congenital anomaly registers.In these registers, children are enrolled when the presence or absence of a malformation is known and, therefore, we classified recruitment as retrospective (e.g.Jentink 2010a; Jentink 2010b).Further, the nature of this data meant that it could not be directly combined into meta-analysis with the data from the prospective observational studies.Additionally, in order to make the results of this review applicable to the treatment of women with epilepsy, included studies were required to include 70% or greater proportions of women taking ASMs for the treatment of epilepsy.This, however, will have reduced the sample size and may not be necessary.Whilst Christensen and colleagues (Denmark Health Record Registers) in 2021 found no di erence in risk estimates in the children of women with epilepsy in comparison to the children born to women with other indications, Hernandez Diaz and colleagues, using US Medicaid Registers, derived data found that, in the context of TPM, the indication did alter the outcome reported.Further investigations are required to answer whether limiting this review to a high proportion of women with epilepsy is required. E orts were made to ensure that the most up-to-date information from the longitudinal research initiatives was utilised, which meant that we o en had to take outcomes for di erent ASMs from a number of di erent papers, or that authors investigated malformation types separately over di erent papers, or published updates for certain ASMs only.The largest challenge in terms of the completeness of the evidence came from some studies not reporting specific monotherapy outcomes or reporting monotherapy and polytherapy outcomes for a particular ASM together (e.g.Richmond 2004; Sabers 2004).However, this appeared to be a more frequent finding with older studies and there was a noticeable trend regarding separate reporting for each ASM for monotherapy exposures. The final challenge to the completeness of the data was in regard to the risk of specific types of malformations, due in a large part to the failure of included studies to publish specific malformation outcomes for all included groups.Whilst this is undoubtedly due to publication space, providing such information is critical for understanding the risks associated with specific malformation types.As demonstrated, in the case of PB or TPM, an ASM exposure may be associated with specific malformations, so reporting only an overall malformation figure may mask important associations.Further, unclear reporting and di erences in the defining of certain malformation types or groups meant that we could not investigate Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews hypospadias or gastrointestinal malformations, which have been linked to certain ASM exposures (EURAP 2018; Sweden Health Record Registers). A few points of heterogeneity were found between included studies, which may limit the completeness of the evidence.Studies varied in how they dealt with the inclusion of foetal deaths or interruptions of pregnancy (with and without malformations) and in whether they counted genetic causes of malformation in their overall prevalence.At the outset of this review, we decided to use the author-defined major malformation rate, as the review authors would be unlikely to have all the data required to determine information about reported major malformations.Considering this, however, we cannot confirm that all the studies applied the same criteria for classifying a major malformation.Further, there were di erences between studies in the time at which the outcome was reported.For example, the UK and Ireland Epilepsy and Pregnancy Register has a major malformation reporting time before three months of age, whilst others included malformation presence at birth (e.g.Bozhinov 2009).Data from the EURAP 2018 collaboration and by Christensen and colleagues (2021) using Denmark Health Record Registers demonstrates that the reviewing of major malformation outcome at 12 months of age leads to an increased detection and, therefore, higher prevalence.Thus, data reported from some studies may in fact be an underestimation of the prevalence of major malformation if the assessment of the child occurs prior to 12 months of age. Finally, major malformation risk is not the only outcome of importance in pregnancy exposures.Beyond the scope of this review, small-for-gestational-age, prematurity, minor congential malformations as well as longer-term child health and neurodevelopmental outcomes can be altered, with life impacting consequences (Bromley 2014 ; Clayton-Smith 2019; Dean 2000) and, therefore, require consideration when understanding the total impact of an ASM exposure on the developing child.Minor malformations, for example, are an important part of the diagnostic criteria for foetal anticonvulsant syndromes, in particular (Clayton-Smith 2019; Dean 2000) and their presence may lead to a more detailed physical examination to check for more severe physical symptoms of exposure or neurodevelopmental impairment. Neurodevelopmental impairments are also a more commonly occurring outcome in the general population and, therefore, will occur more frequently in the ASM-exposed populations and can have a significant impact on quality of life (Bromley 2014; Clayton-Smith 2019). Strengths of this review update include the creation and advance publication of the review protocol, the clear inclusion criteria, extensive searches, the acquisition of unpublished data, the inclusion of articles not written in English, meta-analysis for all possible comparisons, the consideration of specific as well as overall major malformation risk, the balance of both systematic reviewing and content expertise and the assessment of risk of bias and quality in the non-randomised evidence.Further, we improved the quality of the meta-analyses by stratifying by type of control group and importantly study design.The results across the di erent study types were summarised in meta-analysis separately due to the potential overlap in the cases (e.g. a national epilepsy and pregnancy register may contain the same children with a malformation as a population dataset which utilised routine health records for that same region or population).Further, at the start of this review, there were concerns about likely heterogeneity coming from di erent measurement approaches, periods of follow-up and di erent patterns of maternal indications.However, in comparisons with larger numbers of included exposed pregnancies, the prevalences were similar (Table 1 , Figure 3 ).We therefore take the view that cohort studies and studies utilising population level health records o er complimentary evidence which can be viewed as replicating the results of each other, to ensure evidence consistency across the total available data. Under the Cochrane guidelines, this review will continue to be updated every two years, or following the publication of a significant amount of new data, to ensure it remains up-to-date which adds further strength. The methodological quality for each individual study is displayed in the Risk of bias in included studies and in Figure 2 . Randomised controlled trials are thought to be unethical in this area due to the permanence of potential adverse e ects for the foetus.Gold standard evidence for this area would, therefore, comprise data coming from a recruitment approach with low selection bias, prospective follow-up, blinded outcome assessment to a standardised protocol and statistical methods to limit the influence of confounding or mediating variables.Obtaining all of these features in a single study is di icult and di erent study designs have a di erent set of strengths and weaknesses. The RoB ratings provided by an adaption of ROBINS-I, for example, showed that the certain routine health record studies scored at a lower risk of bias than the cohort studies for risk of selection biases, yet the routine health record studies were at higher risk for outcome measurement which was completed in a nonstandardised manner by clinicians who were not blinded to the ASM exposure of the child.To balance these strengths and weaknesses which are inherent within these study designs, a complimentary set of pharmacovigilance approaches are required in order to have an accurate understanding of the data pertaining to possible risk associated with ASM exposures. It should be considered that ROBINS-I is not optimised for pregnancy pharmacovigilance studies where the person taking the medication (mother) is not the person in which the outcome in is being assessed (child) and it was challenging to adopt the signalling questions and ratings to function for this review.Further, the recommended GRADE framework for rating the certainty of evidence was not used, as it would produce di erential ratings depending on whether there were di erences between the medications or not.For reviews of pregnancy pharmacovigilance data, bespoke risk of bias and certainty of evidence tools are required. In conclusion, our risk of bias review indicates that, across the included studies, there are a number of important biases assessed as high risk which should be taken into account when interpreting the results.The biases, however, were thought to be balanced across the ASMs investigated and, therefore, it is not felt that the findings were due solely to these biases. Despite many review articles in this area, there are few systematic reviews where meta-analysis has been conducted and, where they have been completed, there are variations in study methodology (i.e.inclusion criteria).For example, the reviews by Veroniki 2017 and Meador 2008, included both prospective and retrospective studies, studies using population-based electronic healthcare records, and data from case-control studies.Whilst such a wide inclusion criteria led to increased numbers of included pregnancies within the meta-analysis, the comparability of data from these di erent methodological types is unclear.Charlton 2008, for example, had demonstrated di erent rates of malformations from the UK Clinical Research Practice Database in comparison to the UK and Ireland Epilepsy and Pregnancy Register.Further, combining data from population studies using healthcare records with national epilepsy and pregnancy registers may lead to cases being represented twice; which, for rare outcomes, could alter the analyses significantly.We took a more cautious approach and did not combine data from cohort studies with data from studies that used population-level routine health records.Whilst our findings were comparable to the more recent Veroniki 2017 review in regard to VPA, PTM, PB, PHT, and CBZ, we did not have enough data to investigate their finding that ethosuximide is associated with an increased risk of major malformation.Overall, our approach of reviewing and undertaking meta-analysis separately for primary and secondary data sources provides internal comparison and validation of the results which, we feel, is a strength. Further consistent findings were reported by Jentink 2010b who found the prevalence of malformation following CBZ to be 3.3% based on 2680 CBZ children from eight studies.In contrast to our review, however, Jentink 2010b found a significant association between CBZ exposure and spina bifida.However, as in our review, Jentink 2010a found that eight studies (N = 1565 pregnancies) showed a prevalence rate of 7.5% (95% CI 6.3 to 9.0) in those exposed to VPA, and noted an increase in terms of specific malformations.The data reported here pertaining to LEV is consistent with a previous systematic review (Chaudhry 2014) This updated meta-analysis did not consistently replicate the reported association between TPM exposure and oral cle s, but we did narratively review data from the large US Medicaid Registers study, which reported an association.In a previously completed meta-analysis, Alsaad 2015 had wider inclusion criteria which included 3420 patients taking TPM (mixed aetiologies and study design types) and 1,204,981 controls and reported a significant odds ratio (OR 6.26, 95% CI: 3.13 to 12.51).As noted throughout this discussion, data were limited pertaining to the newer ASMs and by the reporting of specific malformations in included studies, therefore, it is possible that the limited data that contributed to this meta-analysis do not consistently uphold this association across all comparisons. There is an obvious delay between the approval of a medication for use and obtaining comprehensive evidence regarding the potential major malformation risk.Some delay is inevitable, however, a longer delay than necessary will limit evidencebased decision-making regarding optimising the treatment of maternal epilepsy whilst limiting potential foetal risk.A failure to document the first few years\\' worth of pregnancies to women on newer medications delays knowledge acquisition and new ASMs use in women of childbearing age may be unnecessarily avoided for longer than required.There are numerous medications approved for the treatment of epilepsy around the world, yet we see many without data at this time.The emergence of population level datasets using routine health record databases will likely have a positive impact on this latency, due to their automatic inclusion of large populations (Denmark Health Record Registers).Whilst low in participation selection bias, utilising routine healthcare data has reduced measurement sensitivity though, and disease pregnancy and epilepsy registers or clinical studies which employ blinded, standardised review of the malformation outcome o er a more sensitive approach to outcome measurement.The pharmacovigilance strategy for the ASMs, therefore, should actively include di erent study designs which balance each other\\'s methodological areas of strength and weakness to form a reliable and comprehensive evidence base. The RoB ratings highlight the issue that within-study methodological improvements are required.Few studies, for example, report on how the major malformation was assessed and determined to be major or minor and whether this was done blinded to the ASM history, despite this being the primary study outcome.Therefore, an easily adopted improvement for research is to encourage the use of blinded, standardised assessments of the physical outcomes and use standardised classification approaches, such as those used by clinical geneticists, including the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) (http:// human-phenotype-ontology.github.io/about.html)to allow for more accurate comparison across studies. Whilst research methodologies have become more refined over the years, for example, by reporting individual ASM types, rather than a single monotherapy group or recognising the importance of ASM dose, there are still several limitations in the approach to data reporting.The provision of an overall major malformation risk figure, for example, is unlikely to be reliable, as demonstrated for PB and TPM, and future data collection and analysis should implement automatic reporting at the specific malformation level, including this as supplementary information.To improve the data at this finer level, initiatives will require large cohorts and, therefore, there should be a movement towards standardised protocols and procedural alignment across research initiatives to allow for large enough datasets regarding specific malformation types for specific ASMs and specific doses. Further investigations are also required into the factors which may modify the major malformation risk.This includes further consideration regarding folate supplementation and regarding the optimal dose for women with epilepsy.As cohorts increase in size, more nuanced investigations into dose associations are required by specific malformation types and future work should also consider any family risk factors.Observations have shown that some women who take ASMs, even at a very low dose, appear to be at higher risk of having a child with an ASM-associated malformation.Further research focusing on identification of genomic variants which might modify how di erent women metabolise ASMs is crucial so that those who may be at higher risk of having a child with a major malformation, even when taking a lower dose of a specific ASM, can be identified and ASM treatment selected accordingly.Whilst this has proven di icult in the past, whole exome/genome sequencing, with careful selection of individuals for testing, is likely to make this more achievable (Ku 2011 ). Finally, longitudinal work which also investigates the longerterm health outcomes of children with ASM exposures should be undertaken to understand the true impact.Where possible, research initiatives which recruit pregnant women with epilepsy for the purpose of investigating major malformation outcomes should also seek to, where possible, utilise these populations to understand child health and neurodevelopmental outcomes.

UGET was associated with an increased chance of a live birth/ongoing pregnancy compared with CTET (OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.30 to 1.65; 13 trials; n = 5859 women; I 2 = 74%; low-quality evidence).Sensitivity analysis by including only trials with low risk of selection bias or by using a random-e ects model did not alter the e ect.We estimate that for women with a chance of a live birth/ongoing pregnancy of 23% using CTET, this would increase to between 28% and 33% using UGET.We considered the quality of the evidence using GRADE methodology to be low. UGET was associated with an increase in the chance of a clinical pregnancy (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.45; 20 trials; n = 6711 women; I 2 = 42%; moderate-quality evidence).We identified no di erences between groups for the incidence of adverse events including multiple pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy, or miscarriage.These events were relatively rare, and sample sizes limited the ability to detect such di erences. Ultrasound versus \\'clinical touch\\' for catheter guidance during embryo transfer in women (Review)\\nBody Text: Many women undergoing an assisted reproductive technology (ART) cycle will not achieve a live birth.Failure at the embryo transfer stage may be due to lack of good-quality embryo/s, lack of uterine receptivity, or the transfer technique itself.Numerous methods, including the use of ultrasound guidance for proper catheter placement in the endometrial cavity, have been suggested as more e ective techniques of embryo transfer.This review evaluates the e icacy of ultrasound-guided embryo transfer (UGET) compared with \\'clinical touch\\' (CTET), which is the traditional method of embryo transfer and relies on the clinician\\'s tactile senses to judge when the transfer catheter is in the correct position. To determine whether ultrasound guidance compared with clinical touch improves pregnancy outcomes in women undergoing embryo transfer during ART cycles. For the 2016 update of this review, we ran updated searches in the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group trials register (May 2015), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (the Cochrane Library, May 2015), MEDLINE (2009 to May 2015 ), and EMBASE (2009 to May 2015) .We also handsearched relevant conference proceedings: American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM), European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE), and International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO).There were no language restrictions. We included only randomised controlled trials. Two review authors independently assessed eligibility and quality of trials and extracted data from those selected.We calculated odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous outcomes.No outcomes were reported using continuous data.We assessed the overall quality of the evidence for the main findings using the GRADE working group methods. The evidence suggests ultrasound guidance improves the chance of live birth/ongoing and clinical pregnancies compared with clinical touch, without increasing the chance of multiple pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy, or miscarriage.Methodological limitations included: only four studies reporting details of both computerised randomisation techniques and adequate allocation concealment, only four studies reported on the outcome of live birth, and none of the nine studies that reported on ongoing pregnancy reported on live birth, suggesting possible reporting bias.Adequate reporting of randomisation and allocation concealment will improve the quality of future studies.The primary outcome measure of future studies should be the reporting of live births per woman randomised. We wanted to learn whether ultrasound-guided embryo transfer (UGET) improves pregnancy outcomes compared with clinical touch.The traditional method of embryo transfer, clinical touch relies on the clinician\\'s tactile senses to judge when the transfer catheter is in the correct position. The inability of some women undergoing fertility treatment to achieve a live birth may be due to a number of factors, such as lack of goodquality embryo/s, problems with the uterus, or the transfer technique itself.This review looks at one aspect of the transfer technique, whether ultrasound guidance improves pregnancy outcomes compared with clinical touch (clinical judgement without any technical assistance). We found 21 randomised controlled trials that compared UGET with clinical touch in a total of 6218 women.The evidence is current to May 2015. Live birth/ongoing pregnancies were increased for the ultrasound-guided group compared with the clinical touch group, based on lowquality evidence.We estimate that for women with a chance of a live birth/ongoing pregnancy of 23% using clinical touch, this would increase to between 28% and 33% using UGET.Data for live birth should be interpreted carefully, as di erences between the studies make drawing a conclusion di icult.The evidence suggests that in studies that used the same brand of transfer catheter in both the ultrasoundguided and the clinical touch groups, ultrasound guidance was linked to an increase in the chance of a live birth.There was no evidence that the risk of harm using UGET, including miscarriage, ectopic pregnancies, and multiple pregnancies, is any di erent than when clinical touch is used to guide the embryo transfer. The quality of the evidence for live birth/ongoing pregnancy was low due to poor reporting of study methods and inconsistency in trial results. Live birth and ongoing pregnancy (per woman randomised) Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Since the first pregnancy using in vitro fertilisation was achieved nearly 40 years ago (Steptoe 1978) , many aspects of the procedure, such as ovarian stimulation, oocyte recovery, and the in vitro techniques of fertilisation and embryo culture, have undergone major revision.In contrast, the technique of embryo transfer has remained largely unchanged.Approximately 80% of women undergoing in vitro fertilisation/intracytoplasmic sperm injection today will reach the embryo transfer stage with good-quality embryos.However, only a small proportion of these women will then go on to achieve a clinical pregnancy, and even fewer will achieve a live birth.This makes the embryo transfer phase the final and least successful step in assisted reproductive technology.Indeed, it is estimated that up to 85% of replaced embryos fail to implant, despite the selection of apparently normal embryos for transfer (Sallam 2002) .This failure may be due to lack of goodquality embryo/s, lack of uterine receptivity, or the technique of embryo transfer itself. Embryos are usually replaced into the uterine cavity through a transcervical transfer catheter between days 2 to 5 of development. Traditionally, the \\'clinical touch\\' method has been used to guide placement of the transfer catheter to within ˜10 mm from the uterine fundus prior to injection of the embryos.This method is essentially \\'blind\\' and relies on the clinician\\'s tactile senses to judge when the transfer catheter is in the correct position.Some clinicians transfer the embryos at a fixed distance from the external os (˜6 cm), however this may not take into account variation in cervical length or uterine size, or position (retroverted).Others will conduct a \\'dummy\\' embryo transfer to determine the length of the endometrial cavity prior to the actual embryo transfer. Assessment of the transfer catheter position using the clinical touch method is o en unreliable.This was demonstrated by Woolcott and Stanger (Woolcott 1997) , who utilised transvaginal ultrasound to observe catheter placement in relation to the endometrial surface and uterine fundus during 121 embryo transfers.They noted suboptimal catheter placement in more than half of cases, with the catheter either indenting or embedded in the endometrium. It is generally accepted that an easy, atraumatic embryo transfer is essential for successful implantation (Matorras 2002) .It is possible that minimising endometrial trauma could decrease myometrial contractions, which could in turn enhance implantation.Most clinicians try to avoid having the catheter tip come into contact with the uterine fundus during embryo transfer (Kovacs 1999), as it has been suggested that this may stimulate uterine contractions (Lesny 1998), which in turn may lead to expulsion of the embryos.Indeed, it has been noted that high-frequency uterine contractions visualised by ultrasound are associated with a lower ongoing clinical pregnancy rate (Fanchin 1998) . The clinical touch method may thus be challenged as a potential cause of cycle failure as a result of (1) initiation of uterine contractility that may lead to immediate or delayed expulsion of the embryo/s, and (2) the inability to accurately identify the ideal location for deposition of embryos, especially in women with acute utero-cervical angulations, cervical stenosis, or anatomical distortion of the cervical canal and uterus. Numerous methods to improve the technique of embryo transfer have been studied in an attempt to improve pregnancy rates, including changing the type of catheter used, performing a trial, or \\'mock\\' transfer before the actual procedure, removing any cervical mucus prior to transfer, avoiding the use of a tenaculum, encouraging bed rest following embryo transfer, comparing full and empty bladder, as well as performing the procedure under ultrasound guidance.This review currently focuses on the role of transabdominal ultrasound. The use of abdominal ultrasound to guide embryo transfer was first discussed by Strickler et al (Strickler 1985) , who postulated that this would allow accurate and atraumatic positioning of the catheter tip near the uterine fundus, along with visualisation of the injection of the transfer fluid containing the embryos.By allowing identification of the cervical canal and endometrial cavity, ultrasound can facilitate atraumatic penetration of the catheter into the uterus, thereby minimising endometrial trauma.Moreover, its use can confirm that the catheter tip is beyond the internal os of the cervix and that placement of the embryos is at the desired level in the endometrial cavity (Lorusso 2005) .This can be especially helpful in women where the uterine anatomy may be distorted by fibroids or septae (Hurley 1991) .For these reasons, ultrasoundguided embryo transfers have been rated as \"easier\" and \"cleaner\" by clinicians (Prapas 2001).Disadvantages are the need for a second operator, a longer time to execute, and the inconvenience of filling the woman\\'s bladder (Martins 2004) .Another possible drawback is that in some cases moving the catheter to improve identification is required, a motion that is not needed in transfers performed by clinical touch.This manoeuvre can potentially disrupt the endometrium, thus reducing the benefits provided by ultrasound (Garcia-Velasco 2002).Another disadvantage is the possible unknown side e ects of early ultrasound on the preimplantation embryo. Studies comparing transabdominal ultrasound guidance with the traditional clinical touch method have reported conflicting results in terms of pregnancy rates.Given the lack of concurrence in the literature, we decided to review the evidence systematically to evaluate this method for successful embryo transfer. To determine whether ultrasound guidance compared with clinical touch improves pregnancy outcomes in women undergoing embryo transfer during assisted reproductive technology cycles. We considered all published, unpublished, and ongoing prospective randomised trials that reported data comparing outcomes of women undergoing ultrasound-guided embryo transfer (UGET) versus clinical touch embryo transfer (CTET) through the cervical route following in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) or Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) including frozen embryo transfers for inclusion.We excluded quasi-randomised (sampling of every n th entry from a list), cross-over, and cluster randomised trials. Women with any form of infertility undergoing embryo transfer via the cervical route (using either fresh or cryopreserved or donated embryos) a er either IVF or ICSI and randomised to either UGET or CTET. The studies had to compare transcervical embryo transfer using transabdominal ultrasound guidance with clinical touch methods. The studies should have conducted a standard IVF/ICSI procedure, using standard protocols for controlled ovarian stimulation and transcervical replacement of embryos.Standard culture medium and catheters should have been used for culture and transfer of embryos, respectively.We included embryo transfers that involved donated gametes or embryos.There was no restriction on the number of clinicians conducting the transfers nor the type of catheters used. We excluded studies of embryo transfer via zygote intrafallopian transfer. The primary outcome measure for this systematic review was live births/ongoing pregnancies per woman randomised.We defined live birth as a live fetus born a er 20 completed weeks.We defined ongoing pregnancies as those continuing for at least 12 weeks a er embryo transfer. 1. Clinical pregnancies per woman randomised (as determined by heart beat detected using ultrasound) 2. Multiple birth per woman randomised 3.

Ease of transfer as determined by clinician We searched for all published and unpublished randomised controlled trials comparing ultrasound with clinical touch, without language restriction, and in conjunction with the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group\\'s Trials Search Co-ordinator. We searched the following electronic databases and trial registries in May 2015. We searched the citation lists of relevant publications and review articles published from 2009 to the present (September 2015), and handsearched the references of the included studies.We contacted commercial entities and experts in the field, where identified, to locate trials.We contacted authors where necessary for missing data on live birth rates. We also handsearched relevant conference proceedings: American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM), European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE), and International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO).There were no language restrictions. A er an initial screen of the titles and abstracts retrieved in the searches (by JB, a methodologist, and KB, a content expert), we retrieved the full texts of all potentially eligible studies.Two review authors (JB, KB) independently examined these full-text articles for compliance with the inclusion criteria and selected studies eligible for inclusion in the review.We corresponded with study investigators, as required, to confirm study eligibility. Disagreements as to study eligibility were resolved by consensus. Two review authors (JB, KB) independently extracted data from the eligible studies using a data extraction form that had been developed and piloted for consistency and completeness.Any disagreements were resolved by consensus.Data extracted included study characteristics and outcome data.Where studies had multiple publications, we collated multiple reports of the same study so that each study, rather than each report, is the unit of interest in the review, and such studies will have the same study ID with multiple references. We corresponded with study investigators for further information on methods or data/results as required (for example live birth rates). Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Two review authors independently assessed the eligible studies for risk of bias using the Cochrane \\'Risk of bias\\' assessment tool (www.cochrane-handbook.org)for the following domains: selection (random sequence generation, allocation concealment), performance (blinding of participants and personnel), detection (blinding of outcome assessors), attrition (incomplete outcome data), reporting (selective reporting), and other bias (refer to risk of bias in Characteristics of included studies).Disagreements were resolved by consensus. We took care to search for within-trial selective reporting, such as trials failing to report specific outcomes, or reporting them in insu icient detail to allow for inclusion of data.We sought out published protocols and compared these with the data reported in the published report. We performed statistical analysis in accordance with the guidelines for statistical analysis developed by the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group.The outcome of live birth/ongoing pregnancy and clinical pregnancy is considered a positive consequence of fertility treatment, therefore a higher proportion of women with a clinical pregnancy, ongoing pregnancy, or live birth is considered a benefit.Outcomes such as multiple pregnancy are a negative consequence, therefore higher numbers are considered detrimental.This should be taken into account when viewing summary graphs. For dichotomous data, we used the number of events in the intervention and control groups to calculate the Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals for all outcomes.The Peto odds ratio had been used in previous versions of this review. All analyses are reported per woman randomised.In studies that reported on outcome per embryo transfer, we sought verification from the primary author/s. We have presented data as the outcome per woman randomised. Where we could not collate such data from the paper, we sought verification from the primary author/s.Where possible, we reported data by intention-to-treat.Where data were unobtainable, we only analysed the available data. We considered whether the clinical and methodological characteristics of the included studies were su iciently similar for meta-analysis to provide a clinically meaningful summary.We assessed heterogeneity using the I 2 statistic.We considered an I 2 greater than 50% to indicate substantial heterogeneity (Higgins 2011). We performed a comprehensive search of the literature.We have included published and unpublished data with both positive and negative findings in this review.We identified no pre-publication protocols for the included studies in our search of the trial registries.Additionally, we assessed publication bias using funnel plot techniques, Begg\\'s rank test, Egger\\'s regression test, and the trim-and-fill plot for outcomes that had at least 10 included trials. Where data were considered similar enough to combine, we employed a fixed-e ect model as the primary analysis in the metaanalysis using Review Manager version 5.3 (RevMan 2014).We combined data for the following comparison: • ultrasound-guided embryo transfer versus clinical touch. Where statistical heterogeneity was found to exceed 50%, we performed subgroup analysis to try to explain the findings.We explored the use of same or di erent type of catheters used in the intervention or control groups. We had planned to conduct sensitivity analyses to compare studies judged to have low risk of bias (those judged to be at low risk of bias for all domains of risk of bias) with those classified as having an unclear/high risk of bias.Instead, we undertook a random-e ects analysis to assess sensitivity to choice of model for all outcomes where heterogeneity was greater than 50%. We have prepared a \\'Summary of findings\\' table using GRADEpro Guideline Development Tool so ware (GRADEpro GDT).This table evaluates the overall quality of the body of evidence for the main review outcomes (live birth/ongoing pregnancy, clinical pregnancy, multiple pregnancy, miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy) using GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) criteria (study limitations (that is risk of bias), consistency of e ect, imprecision, indirectness, and publication bias).Judgements about evidence quality (high, moderate, or low) have been justified, documented, and incorporated into reporting of results for each outcome.Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews We requested data from all authors of abstracts (Bar Hava 2003; Faure 1998; Moraga-Sanchez 2004; Weissman 2003) ; we received a response from Dr Bar-Harva, although no data has been forthcoming.We received no correspondence from the other authors.We requested clarification of randomisation from Dr Li but have received no response (Li 2005).Dr Blake was unable to identify the study requested; she was the head of the research department that submitted the summary but cannot identify the original authors of the study within the institution (Blake 1998). In the 2016 update of this review, we moved Blake 1998 to the excluded studies. We identified 23 publications associated with 21 randomised controlled trials that compared ultrasound guidance with clinical touch.We included 21 trials in the final analysis (Ammar 2013; Azmy 2009; Bar Hava 2003; Chen 2007; Coroleu 2000; Coroleu 2002; Davar 2007; Drakeley 2008; Eskander 2008; Garcia-Velasco 2002; Kosmas 2007; Li 2005; Maldonado 2005; Marconi 2003; Martins 2004; Matorras 2002; Moraga-Sanchez 2004; Tang 2001; Weissman 2003; Wisanto 1989; Zakova 2008) .All of the trials included in the review and final analysis were prospective randomised controlled trials.Twelve studies detailed ease of transfer (Azmy 2009; Coroleu 2000; Coroleu 2002; Drakeley 2008; Eskander 2008; Kosmas 2007; Matorras 2002; Tang 2001; Weissman 2003; Wisanto 1989; Zakova 2008; Davar 2007) For details of the transfer protocol and IVF protocol, see Table 1 .For details of the transfer/replacement procedure, where reported, see Table 2 .For details of day of transfer, whether women were on bed rest or not, and whether they had a full bladder or not, as well as the type of ultrasound machine used, see Table 3 . We rejected 42 of the 104 potential studies outright based on the title or content of the abstract.A er retrieving the remaining papers, we rejected a further 42 studies because on more detailed analysis of the content we found they were not randomised controlled trials or because they were comparing catheter types and not ultrasound guidance versus clinical touch methods of embryo transfer.Ten papers were reviews or \\'letters to the editor\\' that did not contain any original data.We excluded a further five trials that compared transvaginal ultrasound with transabdominal ultrasound (Bodri 2011; Deep 2013; Hauzman 2012; Porat 2010) , or that did not use ultrasound at the time of embryo transfer (Saharkhiz 2014).In the 2016 update, we excluded two studies that had previously been awaiting classification, as multiple attempts to contact the authors of Faure 1998 were made without reply, and we were unable to identify the authors of the Blake 1998 study. The studies were old, and the findings were unlikely to a ect the results of the meta-analyses.We excluded a total of 49 studies (see Characteristics of excluded studies). See Characteristics of included studies table, Figure 2 , and Figure 3 . Tang 2001), one study drew lots using a randomisation table on the day of oocyte retrieval (Martins 2004), and one randomised using tables of random sampling numbers (Wisanto 1989).The remaining studies provided no details of the randomisation method used. Five studies described their process of allocation concealment (Ammar 2013; Drakeley 2008; Eskander 2008; Garcia-Velasco 2002; Davar 2007) . None of the trials used blinding.We judged this to be unclear for performance bias, as although blinding is unlikely to a ect the outcome of pregnancy, the awareness of the intervention by the clinicians involved may a ect the performance of the intervention. None of the trials provided details as to whether the outcome assessors were blinded, and we judged this as unclear risk of bias. Attrition and intention-to-treat analysis: Four women in the trial conducted by Wisanto 1989 were not analysed due to failure during transfer and are not included in this analysis, as their treatment changed and their outcomes are unknown.All of the remaining trials analysed the same number of women as were randomised. Live birth rate was poorly reported, with only four of the 21 included studies reporting this primary outcome. The review authors have retrieved a wide source of data from conference papers, peer-reviewed data, and personal communication with authors.We could not identify published trial protocols for any of the included trials.In addition, 16 studies did not report on the primary outcome of live birth (Ammar 2013; Chen 2007; Coroleu 2000; Coroleu 2002; Davar 2007; Eskander 2008; Garcia-Velasco 2002; Kosmas 2007; Li 2005; Marconi 2003; Matorras 2002; Moraga-Sanchez 2004; Tang 2001; Weissman 2003; Wisanto 1989; Zakova 2008) . We identified no other sources of bias. 2003) .None of the studies reporting ongoing pregnancy reported on live birth and vice versa. Personal communication with two authors resulted in additional data on live birth being received (Martins 2004; Matorras 2002) . The use of ultrasound-guided embryo transfer (UGET) was associated with an increased chance of a live birth/ongoing pregnancy (917 out of 2963) compared with clinical touch embryo transfer (CTET) (686 out of 2896) (odds ratio (OR) 1.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.30 to 1.65; 13 trials; n = 5859 women; I 2 = 74%; low-quality evidence).Sensitivity analysis using a randome ects model did not a ect the overall results.The subgroup interaction test was not significant, suggesting there was no evidence of a di erential e ect between studies reporting live birth and those reporting ongoing pregnancy (Analysis 1.1; Figure 4 ).We estimate that for women with a chance of a live birth/ongoing pregnancy of 23% using CTET, this would increase to between 28% and 33% using UGET (Summary of findings for the main comparison).Using the GRADE approach, we judged the quality of the evidence to be low. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews In the review protocol we stated that where there was heterogeneity we would explore it by only including trials with low risk of bias for all the domains.None of the included trials in the review had low risk of bias in all the domains.We therefore looked only at those trials that had low risk of bias for selection bias (allocation).For live birth (all trials included), heterogeneity was I 2 = 91%.We attempted to explore the reasons for this significant heterogeneity by looking for di erences in the trial protocols. Fresh versus frozen embryos: Azmy 2009, Martins 2004, and Matorras 2002 used fresh embryos only.Drakeley 2008 reported using fresh and frozen embryos (88% fresh and 12% frozen embryos in both groups). Type of catheter used: One of the included studies appeared to be an outlier (Drakeley 2008).We found that in this trial, the catheters used di ered between the groups.In the UGET group, 97% of embryo transfers used the Cook EchoTip, 1% Wallace, and 2% Rocket catheters.In the CTET group, 2% used the Cook EchoTip, 51% the Wallace, and 47% the Rocket catheters.There was no di erence in the chance of a live birth between groups (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.25; 1 trial; n = 1649).Martins 2004 and Matorras 2002 used the Frydman catheter in both groups, and Azmy 2009 used the Labotect catheter in both groups.The use of UGET was associated with an increase in live birth compared to CTET where the same catheter was used in both groups (OR 2.45, 95% CI 1.92 to 3.12; 3 studies; n = 1468; I 2 = 57%).The subgroup interaction test was significant, suggesting that using the same catheter type for both intervention groups was associated with an increased chance of a live birth (Chi 2 = 23.06;I 2 = 96.4%;P < 0.00001) (Analysis 2.1).Sensitivity analysis using a random-e ects model did not a ect this result. Publication bias tests did not indicate a significant probability of the presence of publication bias.Even so, the funnel plot appeared asymmetrical with a gap on the le lower corner.The trim-and-fill plot identified that five trials (favouring CTET) would be needed to make the funnel plot symmetrical (Figure 5 ).With the addition of these trials, the adjusted e ect estimate would still remain significant, but the magnitude of e ect reduced to OR 1.14 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.28). Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Twenty trials reported clinical pregnancies.UGET was associated with an increase in the chance of a clinical pregnancy (1118 out of 3392) compared with CTET (916 out of 3319) (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.45; 20 studies; n = 6711; I 2 = 42%) (Analysis 1.2). Publication bias tests did not indicate a significant probability of the presence of publication bias.Even so, the funnel plot appeared asymmetrical with a gap on the le lower corner.The trim-andfill plot identified that six trials (favouring CTET) would be needed to make the funnel plot symmetrical (Figure 6 ).With the addition of these trials, the adjusted e ect estimate would still remain significant, but the magnitude of e ect reduced to OR 1.19 (95% CI 1.07 to 1.32).Using GRADE methodology, we judged the quality of the evidence for clinical pregnancies to be moderate; the evidence was downgraded one level due to lack of methodological details to be able to make a judgement on risk of bias. Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews There was no evidence of a di erence between UGET (140 out of 1693) and CTET (124 out of 1686) in the incidence of multiple pregnancies (OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.45; 8 trials; n = 3379; I 2 = 0%) (Analysis 1.3).Using GRADE methodology, we judged the quality of the evidence for multiple pregnancies to be moderate; the evidence was downgraded one level due to lack of methodological details to be able to make a judgement on risk of bias. There was no evidence of a di erence in ectopic pregnancies per woman randomised in the eight trials reporting this outcome 4 ).Using GRADE methodology, we judged the quality of the evidence for miscarriage to be moderate; the evidence was downgraded one level due to lack of methodological details to be able to make a judgement on risk of bias. Publication bias tests did not indicate a significant probability of the presence of publication bias. Five papers reported blood on the catheter tip as an adverse event following the transfer procedure (Coroleu 2002; Drakeley 2008; Eskander 2008; Garcia-Velasco 2002; Wisanto 1989) .There was no evidence of a di erence between UGET (126 out of 1397) and CTET (124 out of 1383) (OR 1.0, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.30; 5 trials; n = 2780; I 2 = 0%) (Analysis 1.6). Where reported, we extracted data on transfers that were considered to be di icult.There were no reports in any of the analysed papers on the outcome of foetal abnormalities either at anomaly scan or at birth. The results of this systematic review found an association between ultrasound-guided embryo transfer (UGET) and an increased chance of a live birth/ongoing pregnancy.Heterogeneity was high, with a significant proportion of weighting being attributed to one trial (Drakeley 2008). We identified no evidence of a di erence between UGET and clinical touch embryo transfer (CTET) with regards to miscarriage, multiple pregnancies, or ectopic pregnancies, and the incidence of such events was relatively small.Data on multiple pregnancies was only reported by six of the studies and may be regarded as a source of reporting bias.We have requested data from all authors with regard to this outcome, and it is recommended that future research takes this into account. There was no evidence of a di erence between transfer procedures for blood on the catheter a er embryo transfer.The papers were not always explicit in identifying who was responsible for the embryo transfer and what their level of experience in the procedure was. For the outcome di icult embryo transfer, Azmy 2009 and Matorras 2002 account for the heterogeneity in the analysis. In general, the studies identified are similar enough to make meaningful comparisons.There is still a lack of data regarding live birth, which needs to be addressed in future research.The odds ratios for live birth and ongoing pregnancy are similar, and we have interpreted this as suggesting that the benefits identified for UGET over CTET for the ongoing pregnancy data are unlikely to represent selective outcome reporting. During the searches for this review update we identified a number of trials that used transvaginal ultrasound or three-dimensional ultrasound.In subsequent updates of this review, we will include these trials for completeness. Overall, the included studies could be compromised by their lack of methodological quality.Only two of the studies reported using a computer-generated randomisation and adequate concealment (Drakeley 2008; Garcia-Velasco 2002) .The remaining studies failed to provide adequate detail regarding methodological quality, in particular randomisation method and allocation concealment. Only four studies reported live birth, and none of the nine studies that provided data on ongoing pregnancy reported live birth. Using GRADE methodology, we judged the quality of the evidence for the primary outcome of live birth to be low.We downgraded quality for high heterogeneity and lack of methodological detail to be able to judge the risk of bias. For the secondary outcomes of clinical pregnancy, multiple pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy, and miscarriage, we judged the quality of the evidence to be moderate.We downgraded the quality for lack of methodological detail, which meant that we were unable to judge the risk of bias. We believe that we have conducted a comprehensive and systematic search of published and unpublished trials. However, publication bias may be an issue, with mainly positive outcomes being reported.During the literature search we identified studies that reported either no di erence or a negative e ect of UGET; these studies tended to be retrospective studies and were excluded for reasons of their study design.The study by Drakeley did report equivocal results between the groups (Drakeley 2008).Further, the outcomes ongoing pregnancy/live birth and clinical pregnancy rates had asymmetric funnel plots that may be the result of publication bias.Even so, the conclusions drawn from the pooled results a er adjustment remained unchanged. The review authors felt that the funnel plot for live birth/ongoing pregnancy appeared relatively asymmetrical (Figure 5 ) . It has been suggested that the increase in clinical pregnancy and live birth/ongoing pregnancy may be due to a decrease in di icult transfers.The definitions of what was considered di icult varied between the studies and may account for the heterogeneity found for this outcome.Clearer, standardised definitions are required for comparisons to be made, although the subjective nature of this outcome may influence the findings in individual studies. The exact mechanism by which UGET increases pregnancy rates remains unclear.The main suggested explanations remain the confirmation of the catheter in the uterine cavity , \\'ease of transfer\\' positioning of the catheter, and avoiding touching the fundus or indenting the endometrium. The evidence of this review is congruent with other published evidence, including two systematic reviews with meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials, both of which found a benefit for live birth and clinical pregnancy with UGET compared with CTET (Abou-Setta 2007; Teixeira 2015). The evidence suggests that, where personnel and resources are available, the chance of an ongoing pregnancy or live birth is better with UGET than with CTET. The studies highlight a lack of data for the primary outcome measure (live birth) of the systematic review.It is suggested that future research should report on the live birth rate per woman randomised as an outcome measure that is of importance to the target population.Sample size calculations suggest that 759 women in each arm would be su icient to detect an 8 per cent di erence in live birth with 95% power and α 0.5.The same type Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health.
